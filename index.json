Wiring # The property circuit board was conveniently located only about 7m from the nearest corner of the hut. So digging a trench for electrical conduit wasn\u0026rsquo;t a huge job, even though the ground is hard and rocky. It helped a lot to start it off with the post hole digger.\nStarting off the electrical trench with the post hole digger The electrical conduit has to be dug down 600mm deep.\nElectrical conduit laid in trench at 600mm deep I also laid conduit for an ethernet (data) cable. Getting a data connection was harder because that involved drilling a hole into my house - I let the electrician do that part.\nOriginally I had thought that WiFi from the house would be enough, but luckily my brother did a speed test which showed that I really did need an ethernet cable. The conduit was placed to come up just inside the structural wall frame. That is, within the 35mm service cavity that would later be formed by internal battens.\nElectrical and data conduit inside I left gaps at the ends of internal battens so that wiring could be done without needing to drill holes through them.\nElectrician\u0026rsquo;s wiring in progress Of course, the wiring was done by an electrician. But while the service cavity was exposed, I did some wiring myself: a pair of 2m LED strip lights, through a transformer, placed so its plug came out in a corner where it could immediately be plugged in to an outlet.\nLights wired through wall and plugged in Air conditioning # For a long time I couldn\u0026rsquo;t decide what to do about cooling. Canberra\u0026rsquo;s climate is heating-dominated, but there is usually a heatwave or two in summer. As a non-habitable room, it is perhaps not critical for it to have a cooling system - it could just be abandoned in very hot weather. But then the whole idea of a low-thermal-mass building is that it is flexible: little energy is required to change (and maintain) its internal temperature\u0026hellip; but that is pointless if there is no way to control it.\nAlso, the design ended up with a big east-facing window to overlook the garden. Meaning that it would be hammered by direct sun in summer.\nOnce I had decided that I needed some kind of cooling system, the question was, what exactly? A wall mounted split (reverse cycle air conditioning) system seemed excessive for such a small, highly-insulated room. The smallest capacity ones are rated at 2kW output power and have roughly 0.6L of R32 refrigerant. R32 is touted as having only 30% the global warming potential (GWP) of previous generations of refrigerants: a 100-year GWP of 675. But that still works out to emissions of roughly 500kg CO2e, if the refrigerant leaks or is not recycled.\nWhat is tantalising is that there is a refrigerant that has basically zero GWP: R290, otherwise known as propane. But for some reason unknown to me, it is currently not possible to buy a split system with this refrigerant in Australia. It is available only in portable (duct-in-window) and commercial systems. Sigh. R32 it is then. I went with a Panasonic: 2.5kW cooling / 3kW heating output, with input power 0.6kW. (That\u0026rsquo;s a Coefficient of Performance of about 4.6.)\nThere was one complication with installation. The outside conduit (refrigerant and power to the external unit) would have gotten in the way of a sliding shade screen (see Shading page). Luckily it was just high enough that, if the conduit went horizontally before coming down, the screen could fit below it.\nBend in aircon conduit to accomodate sliding shade screen. Heat Recovery Ventilation # In an airtight building, controlled ventilation must be built in. This can be as simple as a continuous low-power extraction fan (a negative pressure system) or inlet fan (a positive pressure system). But the most efficient is a heat recovery ventilation (HRV) system. This maintains balanced pressure with inflow and outflow fans, and uses heat exchangers to recover and reuse heat from the air (with an efficiency of around 80%).\nI decided on a Stiebel Eltron distributed pair HRV for $1557 (not including installation). I built 180x180mm square holes for the two HRV fan units, as described on the Wrap page. The other part is a box for the transformer and control panel.\nThe HRV control panel box should have been installed flush with the plasterboard, but the electrician had never done an HRV before and was confused, so it ended up being installed later on top of the plasterboard, sticking out. Top-left: HRV control panel; bottom-left: one of the two HRV fan units; right: air conditioner; above-right: an LED strip light The control panel lets you adjust the airflow rate - including a full-on \u0026ldquo;party mode\u0026rdquo; if you have several people inside with the windows closed - and also to choose between\nalternating flow direction: to recover heat and maintain indoor temperature; cross-ventilation: continuous flow in one direction, e.g. on cool summer nights. I found the external covers to be unnecessarily bulky, given that the actual fan unit only extends 30mm past the wall.\nOriginal HRV outlet cover So I made my own out of plywood and some leftover slate tiles.

External sliding shade screens, plantings, awning. Sliding shade screens # East and west facing windows take direct sun for hours on summer mornings and afternoons. Shade from a roof eave above is not enough. (Eaves on these windows are still important though: they allow you to open windows for cross-ventilation when it is raining.) What is needed is a vertical shade. And it should be external - once solar radiation has penetrated the glass, the heat is inside.\nI decided on two sliding screens of timber slats, inspired by designs I\u0026rsquo;d seen from Ben Walker Architects. For the track mechanism I went with Eltrak (nothing at Bunnings is designed for external use). The 4 carriages came to $220 and the tracks $185.\nEltrak Graduate (light duty) carriage and track. Source: https://www.vaterhardware.com/sliding-door-systems.html The wheels of the carriage go inside the track, and the bolt can be secured to a rectangular frame made of square steel tube. Then timber slats are screwed on to that frame.\nIdeally the slats are (a) thin and widely spaced for minimum obstruction to the view; and (b) deep, so that sun is blocked at as low an angle as possible. For this reason I made the unusual choice to mount 42x28mm Merbau screening on its short edge for maximum depth. That meant I would have to drill straight through the long section and into a 20x20mm steel tube - tricky with a hand drill. So I set myself up with a drill press stand.\nDrill press stand for precisely perpendicular holes. Tracks visible in background. I drilled evenly spaced holes in the steel tube frame (use a Cobalt bit). And fixed the slats with 65mm 14G screws (use an impact driver).\nFixing Merbau slats to the steel tube frame I was ready to mount the tracks on the wall using some simple brackets. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the look of the raw galvanised finish on the tracks and brackets. Annoyingly, you can\u0026rsquo;t just paint galvanised steel. You have to remove the galvanisation layer with an etch primer first.\nTrack mounted on wall. Roller wheels visible on the sill. A problem arose that the screen tilts back slightly, touching the wall. So it bangs into the window trim which sticks out about 5mm. I solved this by mounting a few roller wheels on the wall and window sill.\nPlantings # Deciduous plants are ideal good for radiation control if placed well. I planted a Mt Fuji ornamental cherry tree (Prunus serrulata shirotae) to the north. Hopefully it will grow up to provide summer shade over the entry deck area. A strange-looking grafted Acacia to the east is mostly for visual interest but might also help a bit on summer mornings.\nAwning # The entry deck area clearly needs a cover for rain protection. But it turns out that from the sofa inside, there is a nice view up through the glass door to a grand Eucalyptus crown. To maintain that view, I made the awning from clear acrylic.\nView through door and awning I got the 6mm acrylic for $310 from Plastic Creations including cutting to size and providing a joining strip (the awning is longer than a standard acrylic sheet). I fixed it to a steel tube frame with roofing screws. Holes for the screws in the acrylic need to be drilled with a step drill bit on low speed, and oversized 2mm.\nAwning v1 A mistake: I had made the awning too short, so water flowing off the front hit the deck and splashed back. I eventually solved this with a kind of gutter: I fastened an aluminium angle along the front of the awning and cut a hole in it at the centre, which is the low point. That guided the water to one spot. Then I fashioned a spout from a small offcut of acrylic, edged again with aluminium angles.\nAwning v2, with gutter I put an old wok under the spout as a kind of water feature.\nInternal blinds # Internal window coverings are not ideal for summer shading, as most radiation that passes the glass will stay inside as heat. But some can still be reflected back.\nThe big benefit is in winter: by replacing the cold glass surface with a fabric surface, your body will lose less heat by direct radiation to the glass.\nAlso, of course, privacy.\nTilt-and-turn windows open inwards so normal blinds or curtains won\u0026rsquo;t work. Blinds for these need to be attached to the window bead and move with it when it tilts or turns.\nI ordered blockout honeycomb blinds online from UpDown Blinds. The price was $968 for 4 blinds. They arrived just under 8 weeks later. Installation was quite simple once I had read the instructions.

Walls # Preparation # It is necessary to have a cavity behind the wall cladding. This is a warranty requirement of both the vapour-permeable wrap and the timber weatherboard system. But we don\u0026rsquo;t really want to create a cozy hollow for insects etc, so a cavity closer is called for.\nSimilarly, the underfloor space needs some ventilation but could become a home for possums, rats, or snakes. So I attached wire \u0026ldquo;vermin\u0026rdquo; mesh all around with fine 6.5mm holes.\nVermin mesh, cavity closer (white), weathertex corner (aluminium) I decided not to have the cavity open at the top, but to continue weatherboards right up to the eave lining (soffit) leaving just a 1-2mm gap. The soffit was therefore installed first. I used the cheapest material, 4mm fibre cement sheets.\nSoffit layout, with pieces cut from 450x2400 sheets. The fibre cement was cut with a Hardie Knife, nailed in place, and painted. I had made sure that the wall battens were placed just below where it would go.\nFibre cement soffit installed (except front part) Weatherboards # With the battens, cavity closer, vermin mesh, soffit, and weathertex corners in place, I could begin installing the wall cladding: Weathertex Selflok Ecogroove Natural. This is a 9.5mm engineered timber board designed to fade naturally with age.\nJust like with the wood fibre insulation boards, these weatherboards fit together. Once the first course is secured, successive courses slide in from above. They are flexible enough to be bent into the aluminium corners at each end. They were nailed into each batten with stainless steel annular shank nails (for long term corrosion resistance).\nFirst 4 courses of weatherboards installed (each board has an indent to look like 2 boards). And just like with the wood fibre boards, things got tricky at the top of the wall. I had to carefully measure the angles and lengths of the roof line. And installation was difficult because there was no space to slide in from above. On some of these boards I ended up cutting off the lip of the joint on the back of the board, so it could fit on directly from the front (instead of from above). That worked quite well.\nIt might have been easier to use a different material for the top of gable end walls. Top of wall involved lots of angle cutting and cursing. Roof # Roof flashing # Around the roof line, I did the simplest thing possible: a drip edge flashing. Just a square angle of ColorBond steel. It served to cover the edge of the timber roof frame (ie a fascia). I didn\u0026rsquo;t need anything more complicated because there are no gutters or changes in the roof shape.\nSpecification sent to the flashing manufacturer (Lysaght via Agnew Building Supplies) Where the roof frame tapers towards the front of the hut, I folded the flashing myself on a straight edge surface (I used my deck), using body weight and a hammer.\nDrip edge flashing folded to match tapered rafters I fastened the flashing with Roof Zips using a Nut Setter bit.\nDrip edge flashing; tile starter stripwood; butyl rubber nail-sealing tape. The tiles will be shingled on top of each other, so for consistency the bottom row of tiles needs something to sit on top of. That is the starter stripwood, a strip of 6mm plywood.\nBut wherever nails will penetrate the roof wrap, it is good practice to first lay some nail-sealing tape to prevent water leakage into the roof. So at the bottom edge of the roof there was\na strip of nail-sealing tape; drip edge flashing; tile stripwood nailed in. After the flashings were fastened, the top edges were taped onto the roof wrap to prevent water penetrating under the flashing.\nTiles # The ReadySlate tile system is pretty simple. Each module has 6 tiles and they are nailed in through the pre-drilled holes.\nReadySlate tiles being nailed in through nail-sealing tape A mistake: I should have worn gloves when handling the slate tiles, as oil from my skin marked the slate. Each course of tiles was 3 modules (18 tiles) plus another partial module of 2.5 tiles. I cut that tile in half using an angle grinder with a cut-off blade.\nOnce I stepped on a tile and cracked it. Getting it out was messy: cutting the bituminous backing was fine, but I had to completely destroy the tile to get a grip under the nails to pull them out. But once it was out, I could just nail a new tile in its place.\nIt would be significantly easier to replace broken tiles if they were fastened with screws instead of nails. Continuing to lay tiles Another mistake: I stacked some of the tile modules on the roof in full sun. The sun melted the bituminous backing onto the slate below in places. Impossible to clean off. At the ridge I wanted to prop up the tiles slightly to allow some ventilation through the ridge line - which would act as a vapour diffusion port. So I cut some strips of weatherboard and nailed them in.\nStrips of weatherboard to give some ventilation to the ridge line.

External membrane # The external membrane plays at least two roles: a weather resistive barrier (keeping rain out) and an airtightness layer. But these are linked: wind gusts can create pressure differences which force rainwater into any gaps in the structure, unless it is airtight.\nThe details are critical when installing a wrap. Perhaps that is why typical Australian homes are leaky, even newly built ones. It takes a bit of time to get right. Unlike similar countries, we do not have any regulations about air leakage.\nThe National Construction Code 2022 specifies that Class 4 - ie vapour permeable - wraps must be used (other than in tropical areas). There are several products available but ProClima wraps have a good reputation and a higher permeability than others. So I went with ProClima\u0026rsquo;s Solitex Mento Plus 1500 for $479 + shipping from Fribesco. Normally this is only for roofs, where more strength and temperature-resistance is needed. But I could cover my roof and walls with one roll, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth buying two different products.\nAn exploded view of all the wrap pieces. It was actually simpler than that diagram makes it out to be. Installation was in stages:\nunderfloor wrap (see Timber Frame page) under-eave wrap - prior to wood fibre board roof wrap - over top of wood fibre board and plywood wall wrap 1st course - unrolled from door all the way around and back to door wall wrap 2nd course - on each wall separately. All parts have to be sealed together with special pressure-activated 100-year-adhesion tape.\nRoof # Under-eave wrap (laid upside down) connects roof wrap to wall wrap. The under-eave wrap sits on top of the rafter tails and rake eave ladder. On top of that goes the wood fibre board. Then 17mm plywood on top - a requirement of my slate tile system - screwed through 60mm wood fibre board and into the structural frame with 125mm 14G batten screws. These are stainless steel, chosen because it has about one third the thermal conductivity of galvanised steel.\n17mm plywood board on top of wood fibre board I left a 30mm wide gap in the plywood layer at the ridge to form a vapour diffusion port. I filled the gap with wood fibre board pieces (which are vapour permeable).\nGap in roof plywood at ridge for vapour diffusion port Installing the roof wrap was simple enough. Three full-width (1500mm) lengths plus another narrower length. I allowed a 150mm overlap between pieces and taped them together. Around the edges, it was taped onto the under-eave wrap.\nThis stuff can obviously handle rain and is UV resistant on its own for up to 3 months before the roof tiles go on.\nWalls # The first course of wrap was continuous all the way around. I secured it at the door with a half-height batten, then pulled it tight around, and secured it with another half-height batten on the other side of the door. I used the same 125mm screws for these battens as on the roof plywood.\nNormally one would use staples to secure the wrap. But staples won\u0026rsquo;t hold in the wood fibre board, which is why I had to use battens to secure it as I went. First course of wrap around the walls. Then I cut pieces for the upper course on each wall, including overlaps around corners, and secured the corners with 140x35 battens. These extra-wide battens are necessary because the outer 60mm of the corner is wood fibre board, which is not strong enough to screw into. The batten screws have to go into the structural frame which is further back. And battens are needed right up to the corner to secure the ends of the weatherboard wall cladding.\nSecond course of wrap taped to the first course. Note wide battens at corners Other battens were placed vertically in line with the studs.\nThe top of the wall wrap was taped to the under-eave wrap and around the rafters (a fiddly job). And the bottom of the wall wrap was taped to the under-floor wrap.\nTop of wall wrap to be taped to under-eave wrap. I described on the Windows page how window frames were taped. Here is what was done for the two holes where Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV) units go.\nCut wrap and fold it in. Use sill flashing tape to seal the wrap and protect the structural frame. Build a frame out of plywood leaving a 180x180 hole for the HRV. Seal around the edges of the frame with an airtight sealant. More sill tape acting as a flashing on top. These are under cover from the eaves anyway, so should be fine.\nComplete external membrane. Internal membrane # As described on the Design page, I rely on an internal airtightness barrier to keep moisture out of the structure. It is possible to use plasterboard as an airtightness layer with careful detailing. But this seems more risky because (a) it does not allow drying to the inside, and (b) new holes are often made in plasterboard over the life of the building.\nSo I used an Intelligent Air Barrier, ProClima Intello Plus.\nIt was secured with staples and taped together according to the installation instructions.\nCompleted intelligent air barrier\nAnd rather than stick the plasterboard directly on top of the membrane, I fixed 42x35 battens to support the plasterboard. This creates a service cavity where electrical wiring can go without disturbing the wrap or the insulation.\nBattens forming a service cavity Note that internal battens had to be set back from the ceiling peak, because rafter hangers blocked them from being screwed in there.

Coverage # Heat flows preferentially through paths of least resistance. So eliminating gaps in insulation coverage can be more important than making existing insulation thicker.\nFor this reason I decided to use external insulation: completely covering the timber frame. A common choice is polystyrene board. But polystyrene is a vapour barrier. I wanted instead a system that was vapour permeable, as described on the Design page. So I decided on wood fibre board.\nWood fibre board # Wood fibre board is made from wood waste\u0026hellip; as far as I can tell it is basically sawdust formed somehow into a rigid board. It is used commonly in Germany. Indeed the only wood fibre boards available in Australia are imported from Germany. Someone should really make them locally. I got a pallet of Steico DuoDry 60mm from Insulate Naturally for $2600 + $390 delivery.\nWood fibre board delivery A pallet of Steico DuoDry 60mm is 36 boards, each covering 2205 x 575 mm. That worked out to be a perfect amount for my design. The 60mm thick board has an R value (a measure of resistance to heat flow) of 1.4. But that number may understate its performance due to (a) its gapless coverage, and (b) thermal mass which helps prevent summer heating. (Note this thermal mass is not exposed internally, so won\u0026rsquo;t cause winter discomfort like a concrete floor can.)\nThe boards fit together with a tongue-and-groove and are easily cut with a saw. Once the first course is positioned at the right level and held with a few nails, the others just slot in on top.\nFitting wood fibre boards together with their tongue and groove. It does get more tricky at the top of the wall. Because the groove has to slide in from above or the side, each piece between rafters had to be cut separately.\nSome specially cut top-of-wall pieces Some (other) specially cut top-of-wall pieces, installed It would probably have made more sense to install the wall wood fibre board before installing the roof frame so that the rafters didn\u0026rsquo;t get in the way. The roof was much easier than the walls because there were no cutouts for windows or rafters. The only complication was the ridge. Here I am measuring the length and angles to cut the final boards on each side of the roof.\nMeasuring up final boards on each side of the roof Finished ridge The boards are said to be water repellent, but to be safe I did cover the whole thing with plastic sheet when it rained.\nCompleted wood fibre board insulation layer Glasswool batts # By far the most common form of insulation in Australia is glasswool - made from recycled glass. As it is light fluffy stuff,\nit tends to sag over time. That is a problem if it creates gaps where the insulation is bypassed; it can be penetrated by air if exposed to moving air. Insulation is most effective when airtight. The roof frame is 140mm deep which is enough for R4.0 high density batts.\nGlasswool batts being installed in the ceiling. These are full-size batts; the remaining ones had to be cut to size. Wood fibre boards are visible behind. The batts should be precisely cut and fully recovered to fill the space. Friction should hold them in place, but I also ran some strapping over the ceiling batts.\nThe wall frame is 90mm deep which is enough for R2.5 high density batts. Actually, it is possible to get R2.7 batts, but it\u0026rsquo;s really not worth the extra cost.\nSo that brings the wall R value to roughly 2.5 + 1.4 ≈ 4 and the ceiling R value to 4.0 + 1.4 ≈ 5.5. The underfloor glasswool batts were R2.5. For comparison, typical new Australian houses would have R2.5 walls and R6.0 ceiling batts. Again though, just talking about R values is misleading because it ignores coverage details and airtightness details.\n","date":"24 January 2024","permalink":"/posts/the-pea-hut/5-insulation/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Wood fibre board + glasswool batts.\n\u003c/div\u003e","title":"Insulation"},{"content":" Mind blown: windows that don\u0026rsquo;t suck. uPVC frames. Windows suck energy # I\u0026rsquo;d learned in my work modelling houses for energy ratings, that windows are usually the weakest point in any house design. And that few people are aware of how much energy is going straight out through their windows.\nBoth the glazing and frame parts are important.\nGlazing performance depends on the number of air gaps (i.e. number of layers of glass), any non-conductive gas filling the air gaps, and any special coatings on the glass. For a cool climate this would be a clear low-emissivity coating.\nFrame performance depends on the material and how well it seals against air leakage.\nAluminium and steel frames are extremely conductive, so can transfer as much heat as the glass even with a smaller area. Timber frames are quite good insulators. The downside of timber is that it requires regular maintenance and can warp over time to create air leakage. uPVC frames are good insulators like timber, require no maintenance, and seal extremely well. It is the most common frame material in most of Europe. One consideration is that the frames are wider than other types. Chosen specs # My design has three windows (yes the door counts as a window):\nNorth-facing door 960mm wide x 1795mm high East-facing window 850mm opening part (tilt-and-turn) and 400mm fixed part; both 865mm high West-facing window 765mm wide x 795mm high opening (tilt-and-turn) These measurements are for the window frames; the structural framing allows 50mm extra for trim and installation.\nI went with a local supplier of uPVC windows, Malplas. The 3 windows cost $4954 total. I paid a bit more for installation of the frames, but if I did it again I would do the installation myself.\nQuote for one of the windows (ex GST). They are double-glazed with these layers:\n4mm Low-E Prime Toughened glass 20mm Argon-filled gap 4mm Clear Toughened glass The U value - a measure of heat conductivity - for the window system including glass and frame is 1.9. That\u0026rsquo;s good for a window, by Australian standards, though it still lets about 5 times as much heat through as a decent wall. The glazing part has a U value of 1.7, which is almost as good as it gets for double glazing.\nThe SHGC value - solar heat gain coefficient - measures how much any sunlight hitting the window will be able to heat up the room. The glazing here has a SHGC of 55% (as a percentage of pure sunlight\u0026rsquo;s heating power). That is lower than I would normally recommend for Canberra, but in this case there is east and west facing glass so it is vulnerable to overheating.\nInstallation # Installation of the frames was just a matter of getting them level within the rough opening, adjusting the reveal to line up with the plasterboard later (i.e. 45mm inside), then screwing it in place. The small gap left was filled with insulating low-expansion foam.\nFilling the gap around the window frame with low-expansion foam. Installation screw is visible. Finishing # Jumping ahead in the series here\u0026hellip;\nOn the outside, nothing else was done until the external wrap was in place. Then battens were placed around the window sides and bottom, in line with the structural frame. These would act as supports for the window trim, as well as for the weatherboard cladding. The bottom batten was positioned down slightly so that the sill would slope down for drainage.\nBattens around the window frame. Before the trim, I needed to install flashing tape to protect the structural frame from any water intrusion, as well as to complete the external airtightness layer. The tape must attach to the edge of the window frame.\nIt was a bit difficult to get the tape in and secured to the frame after the battens were in place. Some installation guides call for this tape to be installed before the windows. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. Sill tape fastened to window frame and extending to outside edge. The trim was H3 treated pre-primed pine, 110 x 18 mm, painted Pale Eucalypt and screwed in place.\nThe depth of the trim was designed to line up with the weatherboards.\nAnd the reveal on the inside was designed to line up with the plasterboard, so that it could be plastered over and did not need an architrave.\n","date":"24 January 2024","permalink":"/posts/the-pea-hut/4-windows/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Mind blown: windows that don\u0026rsquo;t suck. uPVC frames.\n\u003c/div\u003e","title":"Windows"},{"content":" Let\u0026rsquo;s play structural engineering. Materials # The design was based on a structural timber frame. I preferred this to a steel frame which can act as a thermal bridge, allowing heat energy through. That said, I think steel frames can be a good option when combined with continuous external insulation. For example, Joost Bakker promotes steel frame construction. Also, I didn\u0026rsquo;t look as seriously at Structural Insulated Panels or CLT as I probably should have.\nSummary of the timber frame:\nfloor \u0026amp; walls 90x45 H2 (blue) treated pine roof 140x45 H3 treated pine, mostly external cavity battens 42x35 H3 treated pine; some wider ones at corners internal cavity battens 42x35 H2 treated baltic pine; some wider ones at corners floor board \u0026amp; roof board 17mm structural plywood braceboard (wall sheathing) 9mm structural plywood Timber delivery day\u0026hellip; feels like xmas. In a previous obsession I had built a greenhouse out of PVC conduit bent into hoops covered with plastic sheeting. This came in handy to keep the timber dry. Probably not really necessary\u0026hellip; but if it does get wet, timber should be allowed to fully dry before it is closed in.\nHoophouse converted to timber storage area Floor # Continuing from where we left off on the previous page. Pairs of 90x45s were glued-and-screwed together to form 90x90 floor beams. (for some reason this is much cheaper than buying actual 90x90 beams). To fit them onto the rods, I marked the positions of the rods then drilled through with a 25mm spade bit. Then a larger diameter hole drilled down half way, so that a nut can be screwed down into it.\nDrilling holes in the floor beams to fit them onto rods Before securing the beams, I fitted a sheet of vapour-permeable wrap to sit under the floor structure. This prevents wind-washing of the insulation, and hopefully stops things making a home in the insulation too. Then I screwed the beams together at the corners.\nThis was a mistake. When I later cut the rods off with an angle grinder, sparks made tiny holes in the wrap (even though I used a blanket to try to prevent it). My original idea was to put the insulation in first, so that it would protect the wrap from sparks - but the glasswool insulation fibres themselves burned. I should have cut off the rods before laying the wrap. Anyway\u0026hellip; I managed to tape up most of the holes.\nFloor beams screwed together; vapour-permeable wrap under. I made sure that the electrical conduit from the trench - that would have wiring run through it later - came up just inside the floor beam. See Electricals page.\nI had to measure the length of each joist before cutting: the frame wasn\u0026rsquo;t perfectly square because of wobbles in the positions of the rods. They were fastenerd to the beams using joist hangers.\nFloor joist being fastened to beam with a joist hanger A total of 4 battens were attached to the underside of the floor frame, perpendicular to joists, in order to hold up the wrap and insulation.\nAnother mistake: these long battens were more flexible than I expected, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get in under them to fasten them except at the ends. So they ended up sagging significantly. To fix the sagging I pushed concrete blocks in under the middle of the battens. It was difficult and annoying, but it worked ok in the end.\nAll joists in place; rods cut off flush. Finally I could place 90mm insulation batts. I had the joists at a standard 600mm spacing so mostly the batts could fit in without trimming.\nThe whole 3m x 3m frame was to be covered with a plywood subfloor. Since the plywood sheets were 2400x1200 this involved some cutting (with a circular saw).\nAnother mistake: where a plywood sheet was not supported under an edge or corner by the timber frame, it flexed when stepped on. So I had to insert a few more bits of timber between joists at these points - cutting insulation where necessary to make way. Underfloor glasswool insulation batts; plywood subfloor. I joined the edges of the boards - and around the electrical conduit hole - with a polyurethane sealant.\nWalls and roof # The main structural idea with this kind of cathedral design (gable roof with vaulted ceiling), is to support the ridge beam with posts at each end. Then the rafters won\u0026rsquo;t be pushing out the other walls, rather they will be helping to hold the walls together.\nRidge beam supported by posts at each end. Source: https://www.homebuildingandrepairs.com/framing/roofs/vaulted_roof_framing_basics.html I spaced the wall studs at 600mm where possible, but had to work around the posts and window frames.\nSouth-east wall frame nailed together (sitting on top of another wall with its braceboard applied). After I had a wall together and made it square, I nailed on 9mm plywood sheathing to brace it, i.e. prevent it from leaning left or right. This braceboard also served to hold the structure together and resist wind uplift, because it extended down to be nailed onto the floor beams, and also extended up to be nailed on to the outer 2 rafters.\nAnother mistake: I fastened noggings between studs before trying to square and brace the wall. That makes it much harder to adjust. With each wall assembled, they could be tilted up and secured.\nJoining walls together at the corners with 14G batten screws. I used nailplates where wall top plates meet at the corners.\nOf course the braceboard had to be cut out for window frames, as well as along the slope of the roof and for rafter tails.\nCutting out plywood braceboard: circular saw first, then tidied up with jigsaw and multitool. The ridge beam was secured to the posts with structural steel strapping, and nails.\nRafters were notched to fit on to the wall top plate. Also, the rafter tails on the door (north) side were tapered to give a little more headroom.\nRoof frame diagram. Rafters were fastened to the ridge beam with rafter hangers, also known as slope/skew hangers (see title image on this page). I was also able to cut these in half to make brackets suitable for securing to the wall top plate.\nA rafter hanger cut in half makes a handy bracket. All rafters in place. The rafter tails obviously form an eave on the front and back of the roof; all that is needed is to screw a plank (\u0026ldquo;soffit bearer\u0026rdquo;) along the ends. 140x45 on the back end, and 70x45 on the front (tapered) end.\nEaves on the gable end walls are less straightforward. These are called rake eave ladders. The ladder is formed by fastening pieces sticking out from the outermost rafter (in line with the ridge beam). Then soffit bearers are screwed on to those.\nRake eave ladder.

Foundation system # My vague understanding of raised timber floors was that they needed timber posts set into the ground, or brick piers, both of which sounded like a lot of work and how do you get them all level? It was therefore wonderful to discover the foundation system of Oakwood Garden Rooms.\nThe basic idea is to use threaded rods to hold up the timber floor frame. The beauty of it is that you can get the levels right after it is concreted in, simply by moving nuts up and down the threaded rods.\nAnchors on the threaded rods to be embedded in concrete: 100mm square washers. More of these are used on the other end to hold up the timber frame. Ground works # I marked out the site by measuring from block boundaries, deciding which direction the building would face, and measuring a square. I also had to figure out what height I wanted the finished ground level to be and how this varied from corner to corner.\nMarking out and starting to dig Marking out a square is surprisingly hard. I tried using a square-edge board, using the 3-4-5 method, measuring diagonals, but the method that worked best for me was the rope method (intersection of circles).\nPreparing to use the two-man post hole digger Once I had the string lines in place, I measured out locations for 3 foundation holes on each side and 2 down the middle: 14 total. I hired a two-man post hole digger for a day. It was a little scary because we kept hitting rocks and getting kick-back, but my 80-year-old mother was able to handle it opposite me. She\u0026rsquo;s pretty awesome.\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy with the depth of some of the holes so I finished them off by hand, getting them down to at least 600mm.\nHoles ready for concrete and rods Drainage # The ground should slope away from the building all around to keep the underfloor dry. Particularly since the floor beams had to be quite close to the ground (around 200mm) to stay within the height limit. Also, I did not want gutters on the roof for aesthetic reasons. So I dug French drains all around and ran a hose on it to test the drainage.\nDrainage test The low point is at the bottom of that image. Not visible is a large drainage outflow pipe filled with gravel.\nThe whole site was later covered with gravel. I went with Scoria, a porous volcanic rock. Not river gravel because mining rivers is horribly damaging.\n5 cubic metres of Scoria - but only half was used for this project Concreting # It was slightly cheaper than mixing bags of concrete - and much easier - to get a truck delivery.

With the concrete in, we\ntamped down the anchors to remove air pockets positioned the rods at the string line made the rods plumb (vertical) using a plumb bob They didn\u0026rsquo;t need support while the concrete set; the concrete was thick enough to hold them in place.\nRods embedded in concrete, vertical and lined up with string lines Levelling # Now the fun part. Getting the beam supports all level was easy. It\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of setting one to the right level, then adjusting the next to match using a spirit level balanced between them. There are 2 nuts under each square washer. Once all were correctly aligned, I went around and tightened the lower nut hard up against the upper net to lock them in place.\nAdjusting all the frame supports to the same level.

Use energy wisely. Be healthy. Scope # To keep things affordable and low-key, I decided on a single room of 3x3 metres. If I also kept the height above natural ground level within 3m, I would not need building approval. After a great deal of uncertainty, I eventually talked to a government officer and discovered that I would not need development approval either, as long as it was built within certain setbacks from the block boundaries. (Unfortunately this was after I had paid $645 to lodge a development application and $1595 for a surveyor.)\nMy development application showed the site survey with proposed building location Having no toilet obviously limits the usefulness of the room - you could not live there. But all the options were problematic. Plumbing would be expensive and disruptive. Composting toilets require excavation and maintenance. Incinerating toilets require lots of ventilation that is inconsistent with my thermal integrity goals.\nMy wife and I agreed on a budget of around $30k.\nI looked at several prefabricated, kit, or builder packages for garden studios. However, most would have poor thermal integrity or require a great deal of alteration work to get reasonable thermal performance and appropriately placed windows. The builder packages I looked at were expensive - around $100k.\nSo, with no prior experience, I set about learning how to do it myself.\nPhilosophy # My research and work led me to these guiding principles:\nHigh performance windows Windows are holes in the building fabric. They are hotspots of heat transfer. Investing in windows pays off disproportionately to their area. Continuous insulation Heat flows through the paths of least resistance. It is better to have complete coverage of thin insulation, than patchy coverage of thick insulation. So it makes sense to cover over the structural frame of the house, not just insulate in the gaps within the frame. Airtightness Uncontrolled air movement between inside and outside is a major cause of energy waste and discomfort, and reduces the effectiveness of insulation. Low thermal mass Despite conventional wisdom, high thermal mass (e.g. concrete) construction is often uncomfortable. This is obvious in mostly-cold climates like Canberra. Another reason to avoid high thermal mass construction is the carbon emissions associated with its production. Solar control Direct sunlight is I think essential for wellbeing in winter. But we need to control direct sunlight in summer. Roof eaves should be generous enough to provide good shade from above. East and west windows need seasonal external shading. Of course, I did not come up with any of this myself. All these principles (except for low thermal mass) are standard in good building systems such as PassivHaus, and increasingly mainstream in Europe and the US. Shockingly, they are still unusual in Australia.\nDesign # I spent about 8 weeks on research and design, going through several iterations.\nAn early concept sketch The combination of these design considerations was tricky:\nheight \u0026lt; 3m above ground level (see above) a gable roof (my daughter\u0026rsquo;s wish for a cottage vibe) sufficient slope on the roof for roof tiles (cottage vibe again) vapour control (see below) Having a gable roof with the required 18° slope brings one end of the roof down so far that only a low door can fit in there.\nAside: I could instead have had the door on a gable end wall. But I wanted the feeling of the ceiling raking up inside the entry. Like in Michael Pollan\u0026rsquo;s A Place of My Own.\nThis meant that\nthe door had to be manufactured as a window instead of a normal door; the floor could not be raised far off the ground; the roof had to be as thin as possible. Vapour control # If water vapour enters the ceiling or walls, it can condense and cause mould, which is a health hazard and can damage the structure. This problem is managed with some combination of\nreducing humidity inside the house (ventilation) allowing vapour to escape to outside (vapour-permeable materials and membranes; ventilated cavities) preventing humidity from getting into the structure (air barrier) keeping the interstitial surfaces warmer than the condensation temperature (generally using exterior air-impermeable rigid foam insulation) Fine. For my walls, I did the best-practice thing: vapour-permeable materials, covered with a vapour-permeable wrap, which was facing a ventilated cavity behind the weatherboard cladding. So any humid air that gets into the wall can permeate out through the wrap without causing a problem.\nWall design The roof is another story. Typically, roof tiles are laid on a framework of vertical battens then horizontal cross-battens, forming a cavity for ventilation and drainage. But in my case to reduce the height and also make tiling much easier, I chose a system with no cavity. ReadySlate tiles come with a waterproof backing and are nailed directly into plywood board. Alarm bells should be ringing at this point because this creates a vapour barrier. Condendation and mould are likely to form in the roof structure.\nMould damage from condensation in a roof structure. Source: https://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/article/how-to-build-an-insulated-cathedral-ceiling The solution was to use an Intelligent Air Barrier on the inside of the structure, to stop humid air from entering in the first place. \u0026ldquo;Intelligent\u0026rdquo; in the sense that the material opens up to allow humid air through only under high vapour pressure: so in summer when the roof gets hot, any residual moisture in the roof can dry towards the interior where it can be safely ventilated. This system has been promoted by US company 475 High Performance Building Supply and backed up by hygrothermal modelling.\nThe system is however controversial\u0026hellip; several experts consider it risky. To mitigate the risk I designed in a Vapour Diffusion Port and also built in sensors for monitoring the moisture content of the roof structure over time.\n3D model # Computers were supposed to be bicycles for our minds. That is too often laughably untrue, but I think it is true of modelling buildings in 3D. I was able to flesh out my ideas and reveal issues I would never have thought of ahead of time. My tool of choice was SketchUp. I used tags and components to organise things.\nSketchUp tags following the construction sequence The 3D model was also incredibly useful in planning and costing the quantities of materials. I used the excellent SketchUp extension OpenCutList to calculate required timber and sheet materials.\n","date":"24 January 2024","permalink":"/posts/the-pea-hut/1-design/","section":"Posts","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Build light and tight.
