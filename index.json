[{"content":" Costs and benefits. Costs # According to my rough figuring, I spent a total of about $22k on all this work. That vastly understates the true cost because it does not account for my labour.\nHere is a breakdown into categories: Electrification # In this series I have focused on improvements to the thermal fabric. At the same time we have upgraded appliances:\nsolar panels 12.7kW (8kW inverter) battery 10kWh hydronic heat pump (replacing gas boiler) solar hot water system ceiling fans heat pump clothes dryer electric vehicle Having solar panels has transformed my relationship to energy. I am very aware of how much we are using and generating. I feel it viscerally when we are forced to draw power from the grid. Unfortunately, that is what we have to do all winter.\nBenefits # I feel better about my house now. Currently it is winter, and the house is a tolerable temperature, at least in afternoons \u0026amp; evenings. Until a few weeks ago, even though I had poured thousands of hours of work in, I felt that it was fundamentally a failure. Draught sealing, wall insulation, secondary glazing, window coverings, slab edge insulation, box gutter insulation, ceiling insulation, and I was still cold. Then I did a big push to complete the remaining bits of ceiling insulation and gap filling. And at last the dial started to shift, maybe.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the problem with the thermal envelope I guess\u0026hellip; Heat takes the path of least resistance, especially in the case of air leakage. So the returns from effort may not show up until the end.\nHere is an obligatory before / after shot. The \u0026ldquo;before\u0026rdquo; day is 19 June 2023. The \u0026ldquo;after\u0026rdquo; day is 4 July 2024. Fairly arbitrary choice. There are differences of course, the weather was not the same, the previous days were also not the same, we ran the heating differently etc.\nBasically, it was a couple of degrees warmer inside. (It was also warmer outside, but whatever.)\nStudy # Family room # Energy consumption # So\u0026hellip;? # OK. Let\u0026rsquo;s be real. I probably would have gotten a better result, in terms of both air temperature and power consumption, by just installing a reverse cycle air conditioner.\nBut: the house was designed with in-slab hydronic heating. There is nowhere I can think of that a reverse cycle compressor unit could go without being a nuisance. And if we didn\u0026rsquo;t run the hydronic heating the floor would be intolerably cold.\nSo in one sense, my comfort problem is simple: the house is under-heated. If we ran the hydronic system all day I\u0026rsquo;m sure it would be very comfortable, but who wants to do that? There is a limit to how many kWh are justifiable, either financially or socially / environmentally. At least now I feel like I have done as much as I can to reduce energy waste, i.e. heat leaking through the building fabric.\nWhat I would do differently # At design stage, all the problems could have been easily avoided if they had been understood and prioritised. Had I understood the problems early on, before starting to fix them, I would have taken a completely different approach. I would have done a deep retrofit: remove the roof and wall cladding, to wrap and insulate the house properly. Maybe even do a floating floor over the concrete and abandon the floor heating. Mistakes I made: secondary glazing and wall insulation were probably not worth the cost and effort (the mistake here was believing NatHERS); solar hot water was not worth it; solar panels should have all been tilted north on frames. Sealing gaps is one thing that does obviously make a difference (it can be felt).

Service cavity visible behind. After a crash course in plastering from youtube, we smeared most of an 18kg tub of premixed plaster over the joints and screw-holes. Plastering is fun and it smells like watermelon.\nFreshly applied plaster needs plenty of ventilation I used a cheap plastic plastering trowel, but it ended up snapping; if I did it again I would buy a stainless steel trowel.

Soundproofing # To test the soundproofing (sound deadening) performance, the basic idea is to play a loud sound inside, record it outside, and see how much sound was lost in between.\nI used Audacity to generate a sequence of pure tones at the standard OITC (Outside Inside Transmission Class, like the well-known STC) sound frequencies, each 0.7 seconds long.\nFor a baseline measurement in open air I played this through a bluetooth speaker while recording on a microphone (Rode VideoMic) at a distance of 2m. This captures the actual behaviour of the speaker and microphone.\nThis is very much an amateur setup. To do it properly you would have a high quality omnidirectional microphone, an omnidirectional speaker, specialist software etc. Setup for playing and recording test sounds in open air (baseline) Then I played the same tones through the wall, recording at roughly the same distance (2m). I took recordings at three different locations: low outside the door, low outside the front wall, and high outside a front window.\nBefore window treatment # That gave me these sound recordings.\nRecordings of pure tones through (1) open air, (2) door, (3) front wall, (4) window. Shown as spectrograms.\nAs you can see, there is a fair bit of other noise apart from the frequencies being tested. So I extracted the loudness of just those specific frequencies. (In a hacky way: using pixel colour values of the spectrogram image.)\nAnd from that, calculated the transmission loss in decibels compared to open air.\nLevel of soundproofing i.e. transmission loss at various frequencies. Before window treatment.\nThis shows:\nthe level of soundproofing at less than 40dB is less than I had hoped. high frequencies do a bit better - they are easier to block. low frequencies do quite well here considering they are usually hard to block. I think the flooring is working. the recording at the window is worst overall, confirming that windows are a problem. After window treatment # As described on the soundproofing page, I added secondary glazing to all the windows. Then I redid the sound test.\nLevel of soundproofing i.e. transmission loss near window. DG = double glazing.\nThe measurement taken near the window did show a clear improvement across almost all frequencies. More sound was blocked.\nThe measurement taken near the door showed no improvement.\nCompared to Pea Hut # Previously I had built a high-thermal-performance room, the Pea Hut. It has full coverage external insulation of wood fibre, is airtight, and has well-sealed double-glazed uPVC windows. (It also cost nearly 6 times as much to build as this workshop.)\nLevel of soundproofing i.e. transmission loss compared to the Pea Hut\nThis shows that the workshop windows are similar to the Pea Hut windows (glazed door) in sound deadening performance. I\u0026rsquo;m happy with that.\nReal sound # Of course, I\u0026rsquo;m not planning to play pure tones in my workshop. I recorded the sound of my project vacuum, which is probably the most frequent loud sound I generate. It turns out to be nearly white noise, ie spread across all frequencies.\nSpectrogram of vacuum sound inside, then outside with door closed, then inside again.\nI recorded the sound inside with the vacuum, and outside with the door closed. The overall volume dropped about 30dB. Subjectively, it is the difference between intolerable and ignorable. I\u0026rsquo;ll take that.\nConclusions # Overall this project met its requirements. The soundproofing maybe wasn\u0026rsquo;t as effective as I hoped it would be, but I don\u0026rsquo;t regret doing it. Most of the acoustic measures are beneficial for thermal comfort anyway.

Wiring # The property circuit board was conveniently located only about 7m from the nearest corner of the hut. So digging a trench for electrical conduit wasn\u0026rsquo;t a huge job, even though the ground is hard and rocky. It helped a lot to start it off with the post hole digger.\nStarting off the electrical trench with the post hole digger The electrical conduit has to be dug down 600mm deep.\nElectrical conduit laid in trench at 600mm deep I also laid conduit for an ethernet (data) cable. Getting a data connection was harder because that involved drilling a hole into my house - I let the electrician do that part.\nOriginally I had thought that WiFi from the house would be enough, but luckily my brother did a speed test which showed that I really did need an ethernet cable. The conduit was placed to come up just inside the structural wall frame. That is, within the 35mm service cavity that would later be formed by internal battens.\nElectrical and data conduit inside I left gaps at the ends of internal battens so that wiring could be done without needing to drill holes through them.\nElectrician\u0026rsquo;s wiring in progress Of course, the wiring was done by an electrician. But while the service cavity was exposed, I did some wiring myself: a pair of 2m LED strip lights, through a transformer, placed so its plug came out in a corner where it could immediately be plugged in to an outlet.\nLights wired through wall and plugged in Air conditioning # For a long time I couldn\u0026rsquo;t decide what to do about cooling. Canberra\u0026rsquo;s climate is heating-dominated, but there is usually a heatwave or two in summer. As a non-habitable room, it is perhaps not critical for it to have a cooling system - it could just be abandoned in very hot weather. But then the whole idea of a low-thermal-mass building is that it is flexible: little energy is required to change (and maintain) its internal temperature\u0026hellip; but that is pointless if there is no way to control it.\nAlso, the design ended up with a big east-facing window to overlook the garden. Meaning that it would be hammered by direct sun in summer.\nOnce I had decided that I needed some kind of cooling system, the question was, what exactly? A wall mounted split (reverse cycle air conditioning) system seemed excessive for such a small, highly-insulated room. The smallest capacity ones are rated at 2kW output power and have roughly 0.6L of R32 refrigerant. R32 is touted as having only 30% the global warming potential (GWP) of previous generations of refrigerants: a 100-year GWP of 675. But that still works out to emissions of roughly 500kg CO2e, if the refrigerant leaks or is not recycled.\nWhat is tantalising is that there is a refrigerant that has basically zero GWP: R290, otherwise known as propane. But for some reason unknown to me, it is currently not possible to buy a split system with this refrigerant in Australia. It is available only in portable (duct-in-window) and commercial systems. Sigh. R32 it is then. I went with a Panasonic: 2.5kW cooling / 3kW heating output, with input power 0.6kW. (That\u0026rsquo;s a Coefficient of Performance of about 4.6.)\nThere was one complication with installation. The outside conduit (refrigerant and power to the external unit) would have gotten in the way of a sliding shade screen (see Shading page). Luckily it was just high enough that, if the conduit went horizontally before coming down, the screen could fit below it.\nBend in aircon conduit to accomodate sliding shade screen. Heat Recovery Ventilation # In an airtight building, controlled ventilation must be built in. This can be as simple as a continuous low-power extraction fan (a negative pressure system) or inlet fan (a positive pressure system). But the most efficient is a heat recovery ventilation (HRV) system. This maintains balanced pressure with inflow and outflow fans, and uses heat exchangers to recover and reuse heat from the air (with an efficiency of around 80%).\nI decided on a Stiebel Eltron distributed pair HRV for $1557 (not including installation). I built 180x180mm square holes for the two HRV fan units, as described on the Wrap page. The other part is a box for the transformer and control panel.\nThe HRV control panel box should have been installed flush with the plasterboard, but the electrician had never done an HRV before and was confused, so it ended up being installed later on top of the plasterboard, sticking out. Top-left: HRV control panel; bottom-left: one of the two HRV fan units; right: air conditioner; above-right: an LED strip light The control panel lets you adjust the airflow rate - including a full-on \u0026ldquo;party mode\u0026rdquo; if you have several people inside with the windows closed - and also to choose between\nalternating flow direction: to recover heat and maintain indoor temperature; cross-ventilation: continuous flow in one direction, e.g. on cool summer nights. I found the external covers to be unnecessarily bulky, given that the actual fan unit only extends 30mm past the wall.\nOriginal HRV outlet cover So I made my own out of plywood and some leftover slate tiles.

Access to the ceiling insulation is very difficult as we have a raked ceiling; there is no roofspace. To make matters worse, most of the roof is covered in solar panels which prevents access from above.\nI eventually discovered that the ceiling insulation had been laid across the ceiling beams, rather than between them. So there was a 90mm airgap directly above the ceiling, under the insulation. This combined with the lack of any air sealing in the roof, meant that outside air was bypassing the insulation. That is, the ceiling insulation was probably not doing much at all.\nCeiling diagram showing glasswool batts incorrectly laid across beams, rather than between them.\nBending down a plywood ceiling panel to look inside the ceiling Incidentally, this creates a highway (literally) for mice.\nAn ex-mouse in the ceiling.

Shade from a roof eave above is not enough. (Eaves on these windows are still important though: they allow you to open windows for cross-ventilation when it is raining.) What is needed is a vertical shade. And it should be external - once solar radiation has penetrated the glass, the heat is inside.\nI decided on two sliding screens of timber slats, inspired by designs I\u0026rsquo;d seen from Ben Walker Architects. For the track mechanism I went with Eltrak (nothing at Bunnings is designed for external use). The 4 carriages came to $220 and the tracks $185.\nEltrak Graduate (light duty) carriage and track. Source: https://www.vaterhardware.com/sliding-door-systems.html The wheels of the carriage go inside the track, and the bolt can be secured to a rectangular frame made of square steel tube. Then timber slats are screwed on to that frame.\nIdeally the slats are (a) thin and widely spaced for minimum obstruction to the view; and (b) deep, so that sun is blocked at as low an angle as possible. For this reason I made the unusual choice to mount 42x28mm Merbau screening on its short edge for maximum depth. That meant I would have to drill straight through the long section and into a 20x20mm steel tube - tricky with a hand drill. So I set myself up with a drill press stand.\nDrill press stand for precisely perpendicular holes. Tracks visible in background. I drilled evenly spaced holes in the steel tube frame (use a Cobalt bit). And fixed the slats with 65mm 14G screws (use an impact driver).\nFixing Merbau slats to the steel tube frame I was ready to mount the tracks on the wall using some simple brackets. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t like the look of the raw galvanised finish on the tracks and brackets. Annoyingly, you can\u0026rsquo;t just paint galvanised steel. You have to remove the galvanisation layer with an etch primer first.\nTrack mounted on wall. Roller wheels visible on the sill. A problem arose that the screen tilts back slightly, touching the wall. So it bangs into the window trim which sticks out about 5mm. I solved this by mounting a few roller wheels on the wall and window sill.\nPlantings # Deciduous plants are ideal good for radiation control if placed well. I planted a Mt Fuji ornamental cherry tree (Prunus serrulata shirotae) to the north. Hopefully it will grow up to provide summer shade over the entry deck area. A strange-looking grafted Acacia to the east is mostly for visual interest but might also help a bit on summer mornings.\nAwning # The entry deck area clearly needs a cover for rain protection. But it turns out that from the sofa inside, there is a nice view up through the glass door to a grand Eucalyptus crown. To maintain that view, I made the awning from clear acrylic.\nView through door and awning I got the 6mm acrylic for $310 from Plastic Creations including cutting to size and providing a joining strip (the awning is longer than a standard acrylic sheet). I fixed it to a steel tube frame with roofing screws. Holes for the screws in the acrylic need to be drilled with a step drill bit on low speed, and oversized 2mm.\nAwning v1 A mistake: I had made the awning too short, so water flowing off the front hit the deck and splashed back. I eventually solved this with a kind of gutter: I fastened an aluminium angle along the front of the awning and cut a hole in it at the centre, which is the low point. That guided the water to one spot. Then I fashioned a spout from a small offcut of acrylic, edged again with aluminium angles.\nAwning v2, with gutter I put an old wok under the spout as a kind of water feature.\nInternal blinds # Internal window coverings are not ideal for summer shading, as most radiation that passes the glass will stay inside as heat.

They suggested spray foam as a solution. But they could only do the actual spraying, they needed clear access to the gutter\u0026hellip; and opening up access to the gutter is the hardest part. So, I decided to do it myself with off-the-shelf spray foam.

There were a lot of complications with this\u0026hellip; I had to do the spraying in multiple passes, and it often blew up out of control, dripping everywhere. If you spray too much high-expansion foam it can form voids inside. To rectify that I poked holes in the XPS sheet and sprayed in again to fill any voids above. That then expanded back out through the holes:\nSpray foam monsters Family room # The family room has a box gutter running down the middle.

Durable, low maintenance materials. Walls # Preparation # It is necessary to have a cavity behind the wall cladding. This is a warranty requirement of both the vapour-permeable wrap and the timber weatherboard system. But we don\u0026rsquo;t really want to create a cozy hollow for insects etc, so a cavity closer is called for.\nSimilarly, the underfloor space needs some ventilation but could become a home for possums, rats, or snakes. So I attached wire \u0026ldquo;vermin\u0026rdquo; mesh all around with fine 6.5mm holes.\nVermin mesh, cavity closer (white), weathertex corner (aluminium) I decided not to have the cavity open at the top, but to continue weatherboards right up to the eave lining (soffit) leaving just a 1-2mm gap. The soffit was therefore installed first. I used the cheapest material, 4mm fibre cement sheets.\nSoffit layout, with pieces cut from 450x2400 sheets. The fibre cement was cut with a Hardie Knife, nailed in place, and painted. I had made sure that the wall battens were placed just below where it would go.\nFibre cement soffit installed (except front part) Weatherboards # With the battens, cavity closer, vermin mesh, soffit, and weathertex corners in place, I could begin installing the wall cladding: Weathertex Selflok Ecogroove Natural. This is a 9.5mm engineered timber board designed to fade naturally with age.\nJust like with the wood fibre insulation boards, these weatherboards fit together. Once the first course is secured, successive courses slide in from above. They are flexible enough to be bent into the aluminium corners at each end. They were nailed into each batten with stainless steel annular shank nails (for long term corrosion resistance).\nFirst 4 courses of weatherboards installed (each board has an indent to look like 2 boards). And just like with the wood fibre boards, things got tricky at the top of the wall. I had to carefully measure the angles and lengths of the roof line. And installation was difficult because there was no space to slide in from above. On some of these boards I ended up cutting off the lip of the joint on the back of the board, so it could fit on directly from the front (instead of from above). That worked quite well.\nIt might have been easier to use a different material for the top of gable end walls. Top of wall involved lots of angle cutting and cursing. Roof # Roof flashing # Around the roof line, I did the simplest thing possible: a drip edge flashing. Just a square angle of ColorBond steel. It served to cover the edge of the timber roof frame (ie a fascia). I didn\u0026rsquo;t need anything more complicated because there are no gutters or changes in the roof shape.\nSpecification sent to the flashing manufacturer (Lysaght via Agnew Building Supplies) Where the roof frame tapers towards the front of the hut, I folded the flashing myself on a straight edge surface (I used my deck), using body weight and a hammer.\nDrip edge flashing folded to match tapered rafters I fastened the flashing with Roof Zips using a Nut Setter bit.\nDrip edge flashing; tile starter stripwood; butyl rubber nail-sealing tape. The tiles will be shingled on top of each other, so for consistency the bottom row of tiles needs something to sit on top of. That is the starter stripwood, a strip of 6mm plywood.\nBut wherever nails will penetrate the roof wrap, it is good practice to first lay some nail-sealing tape to prevent water leakage into the roof. So at the bottom edge of the roof there was\na strip of nail-sealing tape; drip edge flashing; tile stripwood nailed in. After the flashings were fastened, the top edges were taped onto the roof wrap to prevent water penetrating under the flashing.\nTiles # The ReadySlate tile system is pretty simple. Each module has 6 tiles and they are nailed in through the pre-drilled holes.\nReadySlate tiles being nailed in through nail-sealing tape A mistake: I should have worn gloves when handling the slate tiles, as oil from my skin marked the slate. Each course of tiles was 3 modules (18 tiles) plus another partial module of 2.5 tiles. I cut that tile in half using an angle grinder with a cut-off blade.\nOnce I stepped on a tile and cracked it. Getting it out was messy: cutting the bituminous backing was fine, but I had to completely destroy the tile to get a grip under the nails to pull them out. But once it was out, I could just nail a new tile in its place.\nIt would be significantly easier to replace broken tiles if they were fastened with screws instead of nails. Continuing to lay tiles Another mistake: I stacked some of the tile modules on the roof in full sun. The sun melted the bituminous backing onto the slate below in places. Impossible to clean off. At the ridge I wanted to prop up the tiles slightly to allow some ventilation through the ridge line - which would act as a vapour diffusion port. So I cut some strips of weatherboard and nailed them in.\nStrips of weatherboard to give some ventilation to the ridge line.

Our heating system is in-slab hydronic.\nThe Building Code of Australia 2009 3.12.1.5(c) p.450 states\nA concrete slab-on-ground with an in-slab heating or cooling system must have insulation installed around the vertical edge of its perimeter. This must (i) have an R-Value of not less than 1.0; and (ii) be water resistant; and (iii) be continuous from the adjacent finished ground level— (A) to a depth of 300 mm; or (B) for the full depth of the vertical edge of the concrete slab-on-ground These same provisions still apply in the current building code.\nSlab edge insulation diagram from the National Construction Code 2022\nOne is left to wonder what is the point, if you are going to leave the slab edge exposed above ground level like this.\nOriginal # Turns out we did have some slab edge insulation (as per building code)\u0026hellip; I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know it was there until I started digging. It was EPS in pretty poor shape, broken and full of gaps.\nThis is what happens when you have an exposed slab edge above ground:\nSlab edge on north side (at night). Slab edge on east side (at night). It would probably be a good idea to stop heating up the outside so dramatically.\nPlan # Slab edge insulation is usually simple: a board of XPS (extruded polystyrene) on the vertical edge. But unfortunately, our slab edge is not flat. It seems to be two parts, with the top part set back slightly. And it varies across the slab.\nSlab edge underneath a window, showing that it is not flat. Another complication was that the timber cladding came down quite a long way over the slab edge. I knew I should maintain a ventilation and drainage pathway behind the cladding, so I couldn\u0026rsquo;t just fill that space.\nI came up with this general plan.\nCut back the existing EPS to a consistent depth; Clean the slab edge; Cut two pieces of XPS; Paint the XPS for UV protection; Glue XPS to slab edge; Fill the junction with expanding foam, cut it, and paint it; Back-fill with gravel. When people talk about slab edge details, they usually talk about termites. In my case I did not worry too much about it, because:\nin the existing situation, it already had concealed access for termites via plastic sheet covering the slab edge (which was not doing anything useful as it was ripped and full of holes.) whenever we have a termite inspection, the person checks the walls internally, they do not look at the slab edge. Gravel path sections # Here is a sequence of images following the method above.\nLater I realised that:\nI get a neater finish by cutting an angled piece of XPS instead of using spray foam; I should fill the gap behind the joint with spray foam. Earth section (north) # Windows on the north side are lower than on the other facades: their sills are at floor level. Also, much of the north side faces a garden area instead of the gravel path that runs around the rest of the house. Being so close to earth means that these windows get exposed to soil splashing. Some of these window sills have rotted.\nScraping away a rotted window sill Other factors in this rotting may be\nthe lack of an eave on the north side, leaving the windows exposed to direct rain, frost, summer sun, etc. condensation on the inside. the quality of the timber.

Stop uncontrolled air leakage for a better life. External membrane # The external membrane plays at least two roles: a weather resistive barrier (keeping rain out) and an airtightness layer. But these are linked: wind gusts can create pressure differences which force rainwater into any gaps in the structure, unless it is airtight.\nThe details are critical when installing a wrap. Perhaps that is why typical Australian homes are leaky, even newly built ones. It takes a bit of time to get right. Unlike similar countries, we do not have any regulations about air leakage.\nThe National Construction Code 2022 specifies that Class 4 - ie vapour permeable - wraps must be used (other than in tropical areas). There are several products available but ProClima wraps have a good reputation and a higher permeability than others. So I went with ProClima\u0026rsquo;s Solitex Mento Plus 1500 for $479 + shipping from Fribesco. Normally this is only for roofs, where more strength and temperature-resistance is needed. But I could cover my roof and walls with one roll, so it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth buying two different products.\nAn exploded view of all the wrap pieces. It was actually simpler than that diagram makes it out to be. Installation was in stages:\nunderfloor wrap (see Timber Frame page) under-eave wrap - prior to wood fibre board roof wrap - over top of wood fibre board and plywood wall wrap 1st course - unrolled from door all the way around and back to door wall wrap 2nd course - on each wall separately. All parts have to be sealed together with special pressure-activated 100-year-adhesion tape.\nRoof # Under-eave wrap (laid upside down) connects roof wrap to wall wrap. The under-eave wrap sits on top of the rafter tails and rake eave ladder. On top of that goes the wood fibre board. Then 17mm plywood on top - a requirement of my slate tile system - screwed through 60mm wood fibre board and into the structural frame with 125mm 14G batten screws. These are stainless steel, chosen because it has about one third the thermal conductivity of galvanised steel.\n17mm plywood board on top of wood fibre board I left a 30mm wide gap in the plywood layer at the ridge to form a vapour diffusion port. I filled the gap with wood fibre board pieces (which are vapour permeable).\nGap in roof plywood at ridge for vapour diffusion port Installing the roof wrap was simple enough. Three full-width (1500mm) lengths plus another narrower length. I allowed a 150mm overlap between pieces and taped them together. Around the edges, it was taped onto the under-eave wrap.\nThis stuff can obviously handle rain and is UV resistant on its own for up to 3 months before the roof tiles go on.\nWalls # The first course of wrap was continuous all the way around. I secured it at the door with a half-height batten, then pulled it tight around, and secured it with another half-height batten on the other side of the door. I used the same 125mm screws for these battens as on the roof plywood.\nNormally one would use staples to secure the wrap. But staples won\u0026rsquo;t hold in the wood fibre board, which is why I had to use battens to secure it as I went. First course of wrap around the walls. Then I cut pieces for the upper course on each wall, including overlaps around corners, and secured the corners with 140x35 battens. These extra-wide battens are necessary because the outer 60mm of the corner is wood fibre board, which is not strong enough to screw into. The batten screws have to go into the structural frame which is further back. And battens are needed right up to the corner to secure the ends of the weatherboard wall cladding.\nSecond course of wrap taped to the first course. Note wide battens at corners Other battens were placed vertically in line with the studs.\nThe top of the wall wrap was taped to the under-eave wrap and around the rafters (a fiddly job). And the bottom of the wall wrap was taped to the under-floor wrap.\nTop of wall wrap to be taped to under-eave wrap. I described on the Windows page how window frames were taped. Here is what was done for the two holes where Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV) units go.\nCut wrap and fold it in. Use sill flashing tape to seal the wrap and protect the structural frame. Build a frame out of plywood leaving a 180x180 hole for the HRV. Seal around the edges of the frame with an airtight sealant. More sill tape acting as a flashing on top. These are under cover from the eaves anyway, so should be fine.\nComplete external membrane. Internal membrane # As described on the Design page, I rely on an internal airtightness barrier to keep moisture out of the structure. It is possible to use plasterboard as an airtightness layer with careful detailing. But this seems more risky because (a) it does not allow drying to the inside, and (b) new holes are often made in plasterboard over the life of the building.\nSo I used an Intelligent Air Barrier, ProClima Intello Plus.\nIt was secured with staples and taped together according to the installation instructions.\nCompleted intelligent air barrier\nAnd rather than stick the plasterboard directly on top of the membrane, I fixed 42x35 battens to support the plasterboard. This creates a service cavity where electrical wiring can go without disturbing the wrap or the insulation.\nBattens forming a service cavity Note that internal battens had to be set back from the ceiling peak, because rafter hangers blocked them from being screwed in there.

Coverage # Heat flows preferentially through paths of least resistance. So eliminating gaps in insulation coverage can be more important than making existing insulation thicker.\nFor this reason I decided to use external insulation: completely covering the timber frame. A common choice is polystyrene board. But polystyrene is a vapour barrier. I wanted instead a system that was vapour permeable, as described on the Design page. So I decided on wood fibre board.\nWood fibre board # Wood fibre board is made from wood waste\u0026hellip; as far as I can tell it is basically sawdust formed somehow into a rigid board. It is used commonly in Germany. Indeed the only wood fibre boards available in Australia are imported from Germany. Someone should really make them locally. I got a pallet of Steico DuoDry 60mm from Insulate Naturally for $2600 + $390 delivery.\nWood fibre board delivery A pallet of Steico DuoDry 60mm is 36 boards, each covering 2205 x 575 mm. That worked out to be a perfect amount for my design. The 60mm thick board has an R value (a measure of resistance to heat flow) of 1.4. But that number may understate its performance due to (a) its gapless coverage, and (b) thermal mass which helps prevent summer heating. (Note this thermal mass is not exposed internally, so won\u0026rsquo;t cause winter discomfort like a concrete floor can.)\nThe boards fit together with a tongue-and-groove and are easily cut with a saw. Once the first course is positioned at the right level and held with a few nails, the others just slot in on top.\nFitting wood fibre boards together with their tongue and groove. It does get more tricky at the top of the wall. Because the groove has to slide in from above or the side, each piece between rafters had to be cut separately.\nSome specially cut top-of-wall pieces Some (other) specially cut top-of-wall pieces, installed It would probably have made more sense to install the wall wood fibre board before installing the roof frame so that the rafters didn\u0026rsquo;t get in the way. The roof was much easier than the walls because there were no cutouts for windows or rafters. The only complication was the ridge. Here I am measuring the length and angles to cut the final boards on each side of the roof.\nMeasuring up final boards on each side of the roof Finished ridge The boards are said to be water repellent, but to be safe I did cover the whole thing with plastic sheet when it rained.\nCompleted wood fibre board insulation layer Glasswool batts # By far the most common form of insulation in Australia is glasswool - made from recycled glass. As it is light fluffy stuff,\nit tends to sag over time. That is a problem if it creates gaps where the insulation is bypassed; it can be penetrated by air if exposed to moving air. Insulation is most effective when airtight. The roof frame is 140mm deep which is enough for R4.0 high density batts.\nGlasswool batts being installed in the ceiling. These are full-size batts; the remaining ones had to be cut to size. Wood fibre boards are visible behind. The batts should be precisely cut and fully recovered to fill the space. Friction should hold them in place, but I also ran some strapping over the ceiling batts.\nThe wall frame is 90mm deep which is enough for R2.5 high density batts. Actually, it is possible to get R2.7 batts, but it\u0026rsquo;s really not worth the extra cost.\nSo that brings the wall R value to roughly 2.5 + 1.4 ≈ 4 and the ceiling R value to 4.0 + 1.4 ≈ 5.5. The underfloor glasswool batts were R2.5. For comparison, typical new Australian houses would have R2.5 walls and R6.0 ceiling batts.

(And that doesn\u0026rsquo;t count the translucent polycarbonate areas.)\nA few windows we decided were excessive so we \u0026ldquo;deleted\u0026rdquo; them by filling them in: see the wall insulation page.\nThe windows are timber-framed, which is good, because timber is a good insulator compared to aluminium or steel. The panes are all double glazed (6/12/6 clear). The high eastern windows in the Family room supposedly have a low-emissivity coating too; although I do not have a way to verify this.\nObviously, replacing all these windows would be insanely expensive, and wasteful. So I decided to add secondary glazing: another pane on the inside with an airgap. After comparing quotes for glass vs acrylic, acrylic was much less expensive. And less terrifying to work with.\nHowever, before all that, there was the matter of the attic.\nPhase 1: attic # Walk in the entry and look up:\nView of attic from entry (\u0026ldquo;semi-external room\u0026rdquo;) There is a wedge-shaped attic space over the ensuite that functions as a skylight. Triangular glass panes let light into the entry on one side, and master bedroom on the other side. These are the only single-glazed glass panes in the house.\nView of attic from inside. Access is through the motorised shutter. The attic is more or less just outside air: its fibreglass roof has no insulative value, and the shutter must be kept open to ventilate the bathroom exhaust fan. Side note: we did not realise this for several years, so we had the shutter closed. And so it literally rained inside the attic from all the condensation. See drip marks in photo above.\nIn July 2021 I decided to add secondary glazing to the single glazed panes. I ordered sheets of 3mm acrylic custom cut to fit:\nAcrylic cutting specification for attic\nWith some difficulty I got the panels up through the shutter.\nAcrylic panels ready to be installed On one side, the aluminium frame of the glass worked as a spacer for the airgap. On the other, I installed a small metal angle as a spacer. I used some glass-repair tape to seal over the joins in the sheets.\nSecondary glazing to attic installed It turned out that 3mm acrylic sheets are very flexible. That flex meant I couldn\u0026rsquo;t maintain a consistent airgap: visible in the image above at the join.\nPhase 2: rest of house # In July 2022 I embarked on secondary glazing the rest of the house.\n22 panes for a total of 124.3m2 9 panes (59m2) sit inside the reveal (fixed windows); 13 panes (652) attach to face (doors, casements, awnings). Double-hung windows excluded as impractical 1 each in Living room, Bathroom, Ensuite Bedroom 2 excluded as it is less problematic thermally. Having learned from the attic experience (above), I chose 6mm-thick acrylic for more rigidity. The cost was AUD$5000 including cutting and delivery from Plastic Creations.\nInstallation in reveal # We have nice deep timber reveals on the fixed windows. So the acrylic could sit inside these reveals, but needed a spacer for the airgap. I used 12mm x 12mm Tasmanian Oak beads, stained to (roughly) match the existing frames.\n12mm x 12mm beads for spacers between glass and acrylic I fastened these up against the glass with tiny bullet-head nails. Then I stuck on 12mm-wide magnetic tapes. There is an \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; tape and a \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; tape, one sticks to the frame and one to the acrylic. This is what people say you should do, so that it can be taken off if needed.\nMagnetic tapes, 12mm spacer bead, existing double-glazed unit. Ready for acrylic to be placed. Taking off the backing paper Wrangling the acrylic panels into place with the help of a double cup suction holder. Secondary glazing completed on north-facing windows I also put some silica (desiccant) beads in the airgap to avoid any condensation.\nInstallation to face # For the face-fit windows, no spacer was necessary because the glass is already set back from the face. I just used magnetic tape around the edges, and a few screws for extra support.\nFace-fit acrylic on a glazed door. Desiccant beads visible in the airgap. I used two screws at the bottom for the acrylic to sit on, and a few more around the edges with wide heads to secure it. These should not be necessary, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t quite trust the magnetic tape.\nButton-head screws secure the acrylic Huge panes + height = much difficulty.\nInstalling secondary glazing to high windows in family room. Phase 3: fixes # Some problems arose with the secondary glazing. Specifically, a combination of:\nexpansion and bending of acrylic with heat; failure of the adhesive on the magnetic tape; desiccant beads falling into the gap left by the above. Bowing caused by thermo expansion; the magnetic tape has come unstuck from acrylic. Magnetic tape has come unstuck from timber; desiccant beads have fallen into the gap. So in 2024 I did a round of fixes. I reattached the magnetic tape using VST / Acribond double-sided tape for the acrylic side, and PVA glue for the timber side.\nReattaching magnetic tape using VST / Acribond double-sided tape I also replaced the loose silica beads with a stick-shaped diatomaceous earth desiccant.\nDiatomaceous earth desiccant in the airgap It took me a while to realise what these are marketed for\u0026hellip; 😳\nDesiccant for drying out sex toys I also put in some more screws to prevent this kind of bowing out.\nConclusions # I feel like the acrylic layer has made a difference, even if only to the mean radiant temperature. It is much warmer to the touch than the glass is.\nI was disappointed in the magnetic tape. It works fine on small panes, eg 1m x 1m, face fitted. But on large panes, it simply does not do its job. The magnets are stronger than the adhesive. Especially with panes installed in the reveal, it is not possible to pull the magnets apart. And with thermoplastic expansion, it was necessary to use screws anyway. If I knew this I would not have spent $500+ on magnetic tape.\nI\u0026rsquo;m also not sure the desiccant is necessary.\n","date":"9 July 2024","permalink":"/posts/home-journey/secondary-glazing/","section":"Articles","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Adding another layer to the windows.\n\u003c/div\u003e","title":"Secondary glazing"},{"content":" Made from offcuts and shortcuts. Windows # Windows are typically a major expense. But I did not need anything fancy, so I decided to make my own simple windows and door. I wanted light, ventilation, and soundproofing.\nI had a spare sheet of 10mm twin-wall polycarbonate, enough for the north windows. And enough spare 6mm acrylic for the east and west windows.\nI was aware that the polycarbonate is a better thermal insulator ( U = 2.9) than the acrylic ( U = 5.2 ish). But I didn\u0026rsquo;t find out until later that the polycarbonate is a very poor acoustic insulator, because it is light and rigid. I came back to that later with secondary glazing - see the soundproofing page.\nFixed polycarbonate panels # The fixed polycarbonate windows were super simple. Just cut to size with a box cutter, run a bead of silicone around the edge, and screw it on. I also sealed up the ends of the channels with silicone. Technically they are supposed to be installed vertically not horizontally, but that\u0026rsquo;s just the shape I had.\nTwin-wall polycarbonate fixed window installed Awning window # The middle panel was to be an inward-opening awning window, for ventilation. Having no experience with window frames, I designed it like a cabinet door: the opening part is face-fit with hinges and latches. The opening part (sash?) I made from 30x40mm primed pine. It is rigid enough.\nWindow sash, glued and dowel joined Then I attached polycarbonate to one face of the sash in the same way I did the fixed panels.\nTwin wall polycarbonate ready to be attached to awning window Then I just screwed it in with hinges at the top, and a latch on each side.\nAwning v1, closed. At this point there were two problems:\nthere was no way to hold the window open; once the ceiling was plasterboarded, the window hit it restricting its opening. Both of these problems were solved by replacing the hinges with a friction stay. It holds the window open, and it has a kind of sliding pivot so the top of the window comes down as it opens. As it is designed for windows that are inside a frame (oh I guess that is how normal windows work), I had to mechanically translate the force with rigid wood panels.\nAwning v2 with friction stay, closed. Awning v2, open. Fixed acrylic panels # The east and west windows are triangular following the roofline. Acrylic panels are attached on the outside, just like the polycarbonate panels.\nI had one piece long enough for the whole of the north window - except a minor cutoff at the end which I filled with plywood. But the south window had to be made from two pieces.\nCutting acrylic is a horribly messy business It is hard to find anything that will stick to acrylic. It laughs at most sealants and tapes. The notable exception is this specialist VST / Acribond double-sided tape. I used that for a seal, and also screwed the panels in.\nMounting acrylic panels on specialist double-sided tape Secondary glazing # See the soundproofing page.\nDoor # It\u0026rsquo;s a pet peeve of mine that people neglect doors when thinking about their building fabric.

Windows suck energy # I\u0026rsquo;d learned in my work modelling houses for energy ratings, that windows are usually the weakest point in any house design. And that few people are aware of how much energy is going straight out through their windows.\nBoth the glazing and frame parts are important.\nGlazing performance depends on the number of air gaps (i.e. number of layers of glass), any non-conductive gas filling the air gaps, and any special coatings on the glass. For a cool climate this would be a clear low-emissivity coating.\nFrame performance depends on the material and how well it seals against air leakage.\nAluminium and steel frames are extremely conductive, so can transfer as much heat as the glass even with a smaller area. Timber frames are quite good insulators. The downside of timber is that it requires regular maintenance and can warp over time to create air leakage. uPVC frames are good insulators like timber, require no maintenance, and seal extremely well. It is the most common frame material in most of Europe. One consideration is that the frames are wider than other types. Chosen specs # My design has three windows (yes the door counts as a window):\nNorth-facing door 960mm wide x 1795mm high East-facing window 850mm opening part (tilt-and-turn) and 400mm fixed part; both 865mm high West-facing window 765mm wide x 795mm high opening (tilt-and-turn) These measurements are for the window frames; the structural framing allows 50mm extra for trim and installation.\nI went with a local supplier of uPVC windows, Malplas. The 3 windows cost $4954 total. I paid a bit more for installation of the frames, but if I did it again I would do the installation myself.\nQuote for one of the windows (ex GST). They are double-glazed with these layers:\n4mm Low-E Prime Toughened glass 20mm Argon-filled gap 4mm Clear Toughened glass The U value - a measure of heat conductivity - for the window system including glass and frame is 1.9. That\u0026rsquo;s good for a window, by Australian standards, though it still lets about 5 times as much heat through as a decent wall. The glazing part has a U value of 1.7, which is almost as good as it gets for double glazing.\nThe SHGC value - solar heat gain coefficient - measures how much any sunlight hitting the window will be able to heat up the room. The glazing here has a SHGC of 55% (as a percentage of pure sunlight\u0026rsquo;s heating power). That is lower than I would normally recommend for Canberra, but in this case there is east and west facing glass so it is vulnerable to overheating.\nInstallation # Installation of the frames was just a matter of getting them level within the rough opening, adjusting the reveal to line up with the plasterboard later (i.e. 45mm inside), then screwing it in place. The small gap left was filled with insulating low-expansion foam.\nFilling the gap around the window frame with low-expansion foam. Installation screw is visible. Finishing # Jumping ahead in the series here\u0026hellip;\nOn the outside, nothing else was done until the external wrap was in place. Then battens were placed around the window sides and bottom, in line with the structural frame. These would act as supports for the window trim, as well as for the weatherboard cladding. The bottom batten was positioned down slightly so that the sill would slope down for drainage.\nBattens around the window frame. Before the trim, I needed to install flashing tape to protect the structural frame from any water intrusion, as well as to complete the external airtightness layer. The tape must attach to the edge of the window frame.\nIt was a bit difficult to get the tape in and secured to the frame after the battens were in place. Some installation guides call for this tape to be installed before the windows. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure. Sill tape fastened to window frame and extending to outside edge. The trim was H3 treated pre-primed pine, 110 x 18 mm, painted Pale Eucalypt and screwed in place.\nThe depth of the trim was designed to line up with the weatherboards.\nAnd the reveal on the inside was designed to line up with the plasterboard, so that it could be plastered over and did not need an architrave.\n","date":"24 January 2024","permalink":"/posts/the-pea-hut/4-windows/","section":"Articles","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Mind blown: windows that don\u0026rsquo;t suck. uPVC frames.\n\u003c/div\u003e","title":"Windows"},{"content":" Retrofitting insulation boards for better walls. Shutters # This was one of the first things I did on my home improvement journey. Having gotten hold of the building plans and NatHERS report, I noticed that our masonry block walls were insulated with something called Foilboard Ultra 20. Not knowing anything about insulation at that time, I looked it up, it sounded great. 20mm of EPS (styrofoam) with a reflective foil face on both sides. They claimed an R value of about R2.0 when installed with an adjacent air cavity.\nSo when I realised that our openable shutters were uninsulated, I immediately thought to use Foilboard for consistency with the wall below.\nOpenable shutters on west side of house. Wall below is masonry block, with timber cladding. The west side of the house has 2.4m-high masonry block walls (timber clad), and then 1.5m-high shutters above. It turns out that these shutters are simply standard doors with steel cladding. No insulation.\nThere was only about 40-50mm clearance to the internal flyscreens. So my plan was to mount 20mm Foilboard with a 20mm air cavity behind (cavity spacers made of the same Foilboard material).\nIn the end I was worried that the panels with an airgap behind could be damaged easily, so I only made an airgap on fixed (non-openable) shutters. For the openable ones I directly fixed a single layer.\nOpenable shutter with direct-fix Foilboard (left); Permanently closed shutter with cavity-fix Foilboard (right). Both in Study. Openable shutter with direct-fix Foilboard (right); Permanently closed shutter with cavity-fix Foilboard (left). Both in Study. Knowing more about insulation now, I would do this differently. I know that 20mm of EPS only has an R value of ~0.5. There are better materials such as XPS. Still, something is a lot better than nothing.\nMasonry walls # When I figured out that 20mm Foilboard is actually not great for a wall, I thought I should do something about the masonry block walls that have this as their insulation.\nThese masonry walls are all along the east and west sides of the house. On the west: study, master bedroom. On the east: family, bedroom 3. They are core-filled blocks exposed internally. In winter they are cold to the touch. So if nothing else, covering them with an internal layer would improve the mean radiant temperature.\nThe external timber cladding blocked the exterior. I did not want to attempt to take that off. So I decided on internal insulation. I wanted to minimise the loss of internal space, which meant I needed a highly insulating material. The best I found was Kingspan Kooltherm K10, a rigid phenolic insulation board. For 60mm thickness these have a declared R value of R2.75. I bought 10 boards, a total of 28.8m2, for $1957+shipping (oof) from Pricewise Insulation.\nKingspan phenolic insulation boards being installed in family room Conveniently, the walls are 2400mm high which is the height of the boards. I taped the joints with reflective tape.\nFamily room masonry wall covered with internal insulation I even tried to avoid cold leakage through power and data outlets by making insulation plugs. A bit silly really considering how many other thermal bridges there are in the house.\nPower / data outlet plugs The wall in the study I lined internally with an acoustic pinboard, i.e. 9mm polyester, with aluminium edging.\nStudy wall, insulated internally, lined with 9mm polyester The walls in bedroom 3 and family room I lined with whitewashed 3mm plywood. I also insulated the tops of these walls with offcuts of EPS and Kingspan, and spray foam.\nBedroom 3 top of wall insulation in progress. Plywood lining visible. One problem with internal insulation is that it is a soft material so it won\u0026rsquo;t hold fixings well. You have to be creative with things like shelves.\nShelves that don\u0026rsquo;t rely on screwing into the wall. The master bedroom we decided to leave as exposed masonry blockwork. This room is effectively zoned off from heating (with an automatic door closer).\nExcess windows # If you believe NatHERS modelling, windows are the greatest weakness in our thermal envelope. We have a lot a windows. Of course, the north-facing windows give us solar gain (and lovely direct radiation) in winter. But the south-facing windows do not. I therefore decided that it would be better overall to convert some of the south-facing windows to walls\u0026hellip; i.e. to insulate them.\nThe family room has 9 south-facing windows with a total area of about 19.5m2. I deleted (in a design sense) 3 of them: ones at each edge of the south wall. Those edges were anyway occupied by curtains, so the loss of viewing area is less than it sounds.\nI used the same high-performance phenolic insulation boards as I used on the masonry walls (see above).\nDeleted windows, view from outside The 60mm-thick boards were able to sit within the window reveal. They did not have to be fastened. In fact, the fit was so tight that I included a strap wrapped around the boards to allow them to be pulled back out if needed.\nDeleted windows lined with kraft paper For a while we just left this with a kraft paper covering even though it looked pretty daggy. Then when I ended up with some offcuts of plasterboard from building my workshop, I decided to finish the job. Plasterboard can be bonded to the insulation effectively with foam adhesive. I did not use any fixings.\nI did the same with the window at the other end of the room, not shown.\nOne other window was deleted: one of the two high east-facing windows in Bedroom 3. (The fixed pane; the other one is openable.) That one I lined internally with acoustic pinboard, i.e. 6mm polyester. Importantly, being east-facing, this window gets direct sunlight. If an insulation board was placed there, the double-glazed window pane would heat up like a solar oven! So I made sure to hang shade cloth over the external face of the window. At our latitude, and with the roof eave, the south-facing windows do not get direct sunlight.\n","date":"9 July 2024","permalink":"/posts/home-journey/wall-insulation/","section":"Articles","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Retrofitting insulation boards for better walls.\n\u003c/div\u003e","title":"Wall insulation"},{"content":" Sheet metal with ventilated cavity.

However the exit at the top can be smaller in area than the entry at the bottom. The corrugations in the roof sheet are enough. But critically, there must be a path through the ridge flashing.

I preferred this to a steel frame which can act as a thermal bridge, allowing heat energy through. That said, I think steel frames can be a good option when combined with continuous external insulation. For example, Joost Bakker promotes steel frame construction. Also, I didn\u0026rsquo;t look as seriously at Structural Insulated Panels or CLT as I probably should have.\nSummary of the timber frame:\nfloor \u0026amp; walls 90x45 H2 (blue) treated pine roof 140x45 H3 treated pine, mostly external cavity battens 42x35 H3 treated pine; some wider ones at corners internal cavity battens 42x35 H2 treated baltic pine; some wider ones at corners floor board \u0026amp; roof board 17mm structural plywood braceboard (wall sheathing) 9mm structural plywood Timber delivery day\u0026hellip; feels like xmas. In a previous obsession I had built a greenhouse out of PVC conduit bent into hoops covered with plastic sheeting. This came in handy to keep the timber dry. Probably not really necessary\u0026hellip; but if it does get wet, timber should be allowed to fully dry before it is closed in.\nHoophouse converted to timber storage area Floor # Continuing from where we left off on the previous page. Pairs of 90x45s were glued-and-screwed together to form 90x90 floor beams. (for some reason this is much cheaper than buying actual 90x90 beams). To fit them onto the rods, I marked the positions of the rods then drilled through with a 25mm spade bit. Then a larger diameter hole drilled down half way, so that a nut can be screwed down into it.\nDrilling holes in the floor beams to fit them onto rods Before securing the beams, I fitted a sheet of vapour-permeable wrap to sit under the floor structure. This prevents wind-washing of the insulation, and hopefully stops things making a home in the insulation too. Then I screwed the beams together at the corners.\nThis was a mistake. When I later cut the rods off with an angle grinder, sparks made tiny holes in the wrap (even though I used a blanket to try to prevent it). My original idea was to put the insulation in first, so that it would protect the wrap from sparks - but the glasswool insulation fibres themselves burned. I should have cut off the rods before laying the wrap. Anyway\u0026hellip; I managed to tape up most of the holes.\nFloor beams screwed together; vapour-permeable wrap under. I made sure that the electrical conduit from the trench - that would have wiring run through it later - came up just inside the floor beam. See Electricals page.\nI had to measure the length of each joist before cutting: the frame wasn\u0026rsquo;t perfectly square because of wobbles in the positions of the rods. They were fastenerd to the beams using joist hangers.\nFloor joist being fastened to beam with a joist hanger A total of 4 battens were attached to the underside of the floor frame, perpendicular to joists, in order to hold up the wrap and insulation.\nAnother mistake: these long battens were more flexible than I expected, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get in under them to fasten them except at the ends. So they ended up sagging significantly. To fix the sagging I pushed concrete blocks in under the middle of the battens. It was difficult and annoying, but it worked ok in the end.\nAll joists in place; rods cut off flush. Finally I could place 90mm insulation batts. I had the joists at a standard 600mm spacing so mostly the batts could fit in without trimming.\nThe whole 3m x 3m frame was to be covered with a plywood subfloor. Since the plywood sheets were 2400x1200 this involved some cutting (with a circular saw).\nAnother mistake: where a plywood sheet was not supported under an edge or corner by the timber frame, it flexed when stepped on. So I had to insert a few more bits of timber between joists at these points - cutting insulation where necessary to make way. Underfloor glasswool insulation batts; plywood subfloor. I joined the edges of the boards - and around the electrical conduit hole - with a polyurethane sealant.\nWalls and roof # The main structural idea with this kind of cathedral design (gable roof with vaulted ceiling), is to support the ridge beam with posts at each end. Then the rafters won\u0026rsquo;t be pushing out the other walls, rather they will be helping to hold the walls together.\nRidge beam supported by posts at each end. Source: https://www.homebuildingandrepairs.com/framing/roofs/vaulted_roof_framing_basics.html I spaced the wall studs at 600mm where possible, but had to work around the posts and window frames.\nSouth-east wall frame nailed together (sitting on top of another wall with its braceboard applied). After I had a wall together and made it square, I nailed on 9mm plywood sheathing to brace it, i.e. prevent it from leaning left or right. This braceboard also served to hold the structure together and resist wind uplift, because it extended down to be nailed onto the floor beams, and also extended up to be nailed on to the outer 2 rafters.\nAnother mistake: I fastened noggings between studs before trying to square and brace the wall. That makes it much harder to adjust. With each wall assembled, they could be tilted up and secured.\nJoining walls together at the corners with 14G batten screws. I used nailplates where wall top plates meet at the corners.\nOf course the braceboard had to be cut out for window frames, as well as along the slope of the roof and for rafter tails.\nCutting out plywood braceboard: circular saw first, then tidied up with jigsaw and multitool. The ridge beam was secured to the posts with structural steel strapping, and nails.\nRafters were notched to fit on to the wall top plate. Also, the rafter tails on the door (north) side were tapered to give a little more headroom.\nRoof frame diagram. Rafters were fastened to the ridge beam with rafter hangers, also known as slope/skew hangers (see title image on this page). I was also able to cut these in half to make brackets suitable for securing to the wall top plate.\nA rafter hanger cut in half makes a handy bracket. All rafters in place. The rafter tails obviously form an eave on the front and back of the roof; all that is needed is to screw a plank (\u0026ldquo;soffit bearer\u0026rdquo;) along the ends. 140x45 on the back end, and 70x45 on the front (tapered) end.\nEaves on the gable end walls are less straightforward. These are called rake eave ladders. The ladder is formed by fastening pieces sticking out from the outermost rafter (in line with the ridge beam).

A shocking result. It means that at that pressure difference, all the air in the house would be replaced 24 times per hour. Since my house has 3.4m high ceilings, that is a lot of air. Also this did not include bathrooms. While 50 Pascals is not the typical condition — equivalent to a 32km/h wind on all sides of the house — it is an indicator of air leakage that occurs constantly due to rising warm air (stack effect) as well as wind.\nFor comparison, many European countries and US states have minimum airtightness standards of between 2 to 10 ACH50. The gold standard Passivhaus calls for an ACH50 of just 0.6 — so we have 40× that rate. Side note: it actually makes more sense to calculate air leakage per surface area instead of volume.\nWhile the house is depressurised you can easily feel the air leak locations. In my house there were\u0026hellip; many.\nDoor seals # Our timber doors have sizable gaps. Initially I got sucked in to using the foam strips from Bunnings because they are so cheap, but they don\u0026rsquo;t last long. They get compressed or just turn to dust with time, and also my rabbit and cat keen to get out the door make short work of them.\nCompressible rubber seals work better.\nRubber seal for draught proofing The problem with rubber seals is that they can stop the door from latching closed. Or the door will need to be slammed to close properly. I actually moved the latch plate forward slightly on this door.\nA foldable tape seal can work well with less of an obstruction issue:\nFoldable tape seal - door open Foldable tape seal - door closed I got my foldable tape seals from Efficiency Matrix but you can also get them from EcoMaster.\nThe ultimate solution would be to get doors and windows that have good integrated seals; or failing that to use EcoMaster\u0026rsquo;s Draught Dodgers approach: seals that sit adjacent to the door, not squashed inside it.\nCeiling and wall gaps # My house has an interior of plywood panels on the ceilings and most of the walls. Also Durra (strawboard) panels on some walls. Both are installed with feature gaps of 5mm between. For years I assumed that there was some kind of air barrier behind all these gaps. Ha ha.\nEven when I figured out that they were leaky, I was hesitant to seal them because I wanted to be able to take off the ceiling panels to fix the insulation behind - see ceiling insulation.\nAnyway, when I finally sorted out the ceiling insulation I started to seal these gaps. First step is to painstakingly insert a foam backing rod. If you don\u0026rsquo;t do this, the caulk goes right through and out the other side of the gap. I tried various tools to push the foam rod in but nothing worked better than a teaspoon.\nInserting foam backing rod into ceiling gaps Then carefully run masking tape along the sides of the gaps.\nMasking tape before caulking Use a caulking gun to fill the gaps with black coloured acrylic gap filler, trying not to let it fall out onto the floor, and run a finger along behind.\nMasking tape coming off after caulking Some filled gaps in walls There were also many many other miscellaneous gaps, including ceiling lines and floor lines, junctions with beams, and around doors.\nExhaust fans # Our three exhaust fans were all unsealed. So they are basically big holes. In my experience this is common even in new houses.\nEnsuite \u0026amp; toilet # Two of the exhaust fans vent into a weird attic space \u0026ndash; it took me years to work out how to actually get into it \u0026ndash; so I was able to cover those with DraftStoppas.\nUnsealed exhaust fan from above Exhaust fan sealed with a DraftStoppa Bathroom # The remaining exhaust fan has a vent up to the roof. Again, it is unsealed. The bathroom has a dropped ceiling and the vent goes up through a bedroom.\nExhaust fan duct goes up through a bedroom Strangely, there is an outer 260mm diameter vent, and within that a 130mm vent. I was able to remove the outer vent to wrap the inner vent in insulation, for the sake of the bedroom.\nLooking up: inner vent wrapped in insulation inside outer vent. Daylight above. However this was not great because the insulation was exposed to humid air from the shower below. So I used a piece of airtightness membrane to seal between the two ducts.\nAir sealing the vent insulation I replaced the existing unsealed fan with an IXL Eco Ventflo that has back-draught shutters built in ($57.88 from Bunnings). Finally! That hole is sealed up.\nShutters # The west side of the house has big openable shutters for ventilation. Two have electric motors, and another two are manual. These manual ones are fitted with gas struts (like a car boot) which push them open. To close them, they are pulled in with a rope on an eye bolt, and then a wooden rod jammed into it.\nManual shutter closed - original system This is a clever system and all, but the problem is that it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t pull it closed tightly. There is air leakage all around. You can hear it.\nI did apply draught-proofing seals around the edges, but this did not solve the problem as the shutter was not tightly closed on the seals.\nI tried to find a way to fit compression latches on to the shutters, but couldn\u0026rsquo;t figure out a good solution. Eventually I decided to use a ratchet strap. It is tied to the eye bolt on the shutter, and held with brackets on masonry anchors.\nManual shutter closed - new ratchet strap system This certainly applies a lot of force to pull in the shutter. It even slightly bent the heavy duty bracket. It is suitable for closing it up over winter. In the warmer months I will probably still use the wooden rod.\n","date":"9 July 2024","permalink":"/posts/home-journey/gap-sealing/","section":"Articles","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  A life less leaky.\n\u003c/div\u003e","title":"Gap sealing"},{"content":" The simplest thing that could possibly work. Foundations and floor # The foundations were based on concrete blocks I had lying around. The floor frame and deck frame would be suspended above the blocks using brackets or anchors set into core-filled blocks.\nI started by screwing the frame together from 70x45 H3. Then I dug the blocks down until the frame was sitting level.\nLeveling the deck foundation blocks Once level, I filled the blocks with concrete.\nDeck foundation blocks And when the concrete was set, I secured the frame to each block with an angle bracket (using concrete anchor bolts).\nI did the same thing with the workshop floor frame, except that I actually set anchors into the concrete. The easy way to do this is:\nget the frame nice and level sitting above the blocks on temporary chocks; bolt the post anchors onto the frame with their tails hanging down; fill the blocks with concrete, tamping down around the anchors. Post anchor set into concrete I also laid weed mat and covered it with gravel.\nWorkshop floor frame and deck frame (before joists) Joists were fastened with pairs of minigrips as joist hangers (Bunnings was out of stock of actual joist hangers). Then I screwed down some 17mm structural plywood. And ran wire mesh around the edge to stop my pet rabbit from hiding under there.\nPlywood subfloor Deck # The decking was Merbau 90x19mm boards in random lengths. The spacing worked out perfectly with 6mm gaps between boards. I wanted big enough gaps that they would not get clogged with sawdust like my front deck did.\nI put joist sealing tape on, for good luck. Well, I ran out so I also used some left over butyl rubber tape.\nDeck frame with joist sealing tape Stainless steel decking screws FTW.\nCompleted deck, though not oiled yet Walls # The reason I built the deck first was so I could use it as a work area to assemble walls etc.\nThe timber is assorted - the blue H2 I bought new, but other stuff I had left over from previous projects.\nAssembling the north and south walls I braced the walls with some scrap structural plywood.\nWalls erected Roof # The rafters were 90x45s at 450mm spacing, lined up with the wall studs.\nThe rafters were tied together at the bottom with a fascia board: another 90x45, ripped at an angle to continue the slope of the roof. This avoids ponding.\nRafters with ripped fascia board Rafters were skew nailed to top plates, and also fixed with brackets. At each corner, I ran structural steel strapping from rafter to stud, and from stud down to floor frame.\nRafters forming north eave The east and west (\u0026ldquo;rake\u0026rdquo;) eaves were formed, like a ladder, of connecting pieces from the end rafters. But I had found on my last build that this tends to sag a bit. A solution came from this SkillBuilder video.

Foundation system # My vague understanding of raised timber floors was that they needed timber posts set into the ground, or brick piers, both of which sounded like a lot of work and how do you get them all level? It was therefore wonderful to discover the foundation system of Oakwood Garden Rooms.\nThe basic idea is to use threaded rods to hold up the timber floor frame. The beauty of it is that you can get the levels right after it is concreted in, simply by moving nuts up and down the threaded rods.\nAnchors on the threaded rods to be embedded in concrete: 100mm square washers. More of these are used on the other end to hold up the timber frame. Ground works # I marked out the site by measuring from block boundaries, deciding which direction the building would face, and measuring a square. I also had to figure out what height I wanted the finished ground level to be and how this varied from corner to corner.\nMarking out and starting to dig Marking out a square is surprisingly hard. I tried using a square-edge board, using the 3-4-5 method, measuring diagonals, but the method that worked best for me was the rope method (intersection of circles).\nPreparing to use the two-man post hole digger Once I had the string lines in place, I measured out locations for 3 foundation holes on each side and 2 down the middle: 14 total. I hired a two-man post hole digger for a day. It was a little scary because we kept hitting rocks and getting kick-back, but my 80-year-old mother was able to handle it opposite me. She\u0026rsquo;s pretty awesome.\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t happy with the depth of some of the holes so I finished them off by hand, getting them down to at least 600mm.\nHoles ready for concrete and rods Drainage # The ground should slope away from the building all around to keep the underfloor dry. Particularly since the floor beams had to be quite close to the ground (around 200mm) to stay within the height limit. Also, I did not want gutters on the roof for aesthetic reasons. So I dug French drains all around and ran a hose on it to test the drainage.\nDrainage test The low point is at the bottom of that image. Not visible is a large drainage outflow pipe filled with gravel.\nThe whole site was later covered with gravel. I went with Scoria, a porous volcanic rock. Not river gravel because mining rivers is horribly damaging.\n5 cubic metres of Scoria - but only half was used for this project Concreting # It was slightly cheaper than mixing bags of concrete - and much easier - to get a truck delivery. The 0.5 cubic metres I ordered wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite enough so I topped it up with half a dozen bags.\nThe rods were covered over with plastic bags to keep the threads free of concrete. With the concrete in, we\ntamped down the anchors to remove air pockets positioned the rods at the string line made the rods plumb (vertical) using a plumb bob They didn\u0026rsquo;t need support while the concrete set; the concrete was thick enough to hold them in place.\nRods embedded in concrete, vertical and lined up with string lines Levelling # Now the fun part. Getting the beam supports all level was easy. It\u0026rsquo;s just a matter of setting one to the right level, then adjusting the next to match using a spirit level balanced between them.

The promise # My house was built in 2010 in Canberra (Australia). It was a knock-down-and-rebuild, architect designed, and built by a reputable builder. The construction cost about $700k.\nWe thought we were building a comfortable and energy efficient home. There were huge north-facing windows to capture winter sun, all double glazed and with timber frames. A concrete slab floor for thermal mass. Insulation in the roof and walls; even some insulation under the slab apparently. Some of the walls were lined with compressed waste straw board for extra insulation. Yep, we were pretty smug\u0026hellip;\nFloor plan: excellent north-facing design\nHow bad is it? # Winter # On 19th June 2023, at 9am as I was sitting down to work in my study, the temperature was 13.7°. In fact the temperature in the study never went above 16.9° that whole day.\nTemperature in my study on 19th June 2023\nThis wasn\u0026rsquo;t unusual. The next day, the temperature in the study hovered around 12.5° all morning until early afternoon. And the day after that was similar. Looking at one full year of data, there were 97 days when the temperature fell below 16°. And 13 days when the temperature never reached 18°.\nWe have solar panels, so we generally run the heating (in-slab hydronic heat pump) during the day. Here is our energy use on that day:\nElectricity use (and solar generation) on 19th June 2023\nThe study is at one corner of the house, so it has more exposed surface area than other rooms, but it does have a big north-facing window.\nAt the other end of the house, also with a north-facing window, we have Bedroom 3. Here there were 65 days when the temperature fell below 16°. And 12 days when the temperature never reached 18°.\nSummer # Canberra usually has a big diurnal range: the nights are cool even on hot summer days, allowing passive cooling by ventilation. But not always. Here is an example of a summer day with a not-cool night.\nTemperature in my study on 28th January 2023\nOn this day the study (which is also supposed to be a guest bedroom) reached 28.9°.\nLooking at that full year of data again, there were 89 days when the temperature in the study exceeded 26°. In Bedroom 3 there were 52 days over 26°, and 26 days that never fell below 22°.\nAwakening # I was aware that our house was uncomfortably cold or hot a lot of the time. But I grew up in a similarly cold draughty house so it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem that unusual.\nIn January 2021 we changed our in-slab hydronic heating system from a gas boiler to an electric heat pump. This had the immediate effect of making our heating energy use visible in real time (via a solar app).\nPreviously we had been burning vast amounts of gas, but it was not something we thought much about until the winter quarter gas bill came in. Now that our heating energy use was visible, we monitored it and tried to align it with our solar power. We made sure it was off at peak tariff times (morning and evening), and kept it off overnight. (It is required to be off overnight for noise reasons.)\nAlso, the electric heat pump ran at a much lower temperature than the gas boiler had. (There were a couple of times with the gas boiler when the concrete slab floor became almost too hot to stand on! - the thermostat being based on air temperature instead of slab temperature.)\nAs a result, I was very aware that we were using tons of energy to try to be warm, or at least not utterly freezing, and more often than not, failing. So I had to face up to the fact that there were serious problems with our home\u0026rsquo;s thermal integrity.\nI was so depressed about being cold all the time that I felt I had no option but to retrain as a home energy assessor so I could (a) know what to do about it, and (b) save other people from the same fate.\nHow did this happen? # We as clients did not know enough about what was possible for thermal comfort; what was standard practice in more advanced countries; we were stuck in 1970s thinking about \u0026ldquo;solar passive\u0026rdquo; design; An architect who designed a beautiful house, but didn\u0026rsquo;t prioritise thermal integrity of the building envelope; A home energy rater who made significant errors, and did not advocate for good practice; A building certifier who did not ensure the correctness of the energy rating, and of the insulation install; NatHERS the National Home Energy Rating Scheme which failed to recognise or represent these problems; A builder who created an amazing structure but did not prioritise thermal integrity of the building envelope, especially with air leakage and insulation details; A building industry and culture that did not take thermal comfort or efficiency seriously; Building laws which encoded poor standards, and crucially, did not verify the outcome - there is no accountability for air leakage or failed insulation. A roofing company that - when the roof was replaced after hail damage - did not check the ceiling insulation properly (I did ask them), missing the opportunity to rectify it before it was covered with solar panels again making it inaccessible. Improvements # The awful truth is that the temperature readings above were after I had made major efforts at improvement. Here are some of the works I had previously made to the study:\nadding insulation board to openable shutters; adding secondary glazing to the windows and doors; draught-sealing windows and doors; filling many gaps; making heavy drapes and pelmets; fixing insulation board to internal side of blockwork wall; insulating upper section of wall adjacent to roofspace; insulating the edge of the concrete slab (one side only at that point in time).

But it would have been complicated to get continuous watertightness at the joins. Not to mention airtightness.\nOur house looks out at this part of the garden. So we wanted the workshop to be visually screened by these existing trees.\nSite leveled. To fit the workshop in between the fence and trees, it would have to be narrow. Just 1.8m. And I would have to consider how to build and maintain the south wall so close to the fence.\nAlso, the height at the fence should be kept quite low to avoid shading our neighbours.\nDesign # From a passive solar perspective, the design is obvious. Single pitch roof sloping down to the fence; highlight windows facing north. Lots of wall area to hang tools.\nSuch a narrow space would not allow me to work on large pieces. So I decided to extend the potential working area with an attached deck.

Scope # To keep things affordable and low-key, I decided on a single room of 3x3 metres. If I also kept the height above natural ground level within 3m, I would not need building approval. After a great deal of uncertainty, I eventually talked to a government officer and discovered that I would not need development approval either, as long as it was built within certain setbacks from the block boundaries. (Unfortunately this was after I had paid $645 to lodge a development application and $1595 for a surveyor.)\nMy development application showed the site survey with proposed building location Having no toilet obviously limits the usefulness of the room - you could not live there. But all the options were problematic. Plumbing would be expensive and disruptive. Composting toilets require excavation and maintenance. Incinerating toilets require lots of ventilation that is inconsistent with my thermal integrity goals.\nMy wife and I agreed on a budget of around $30k.\nI looked at several prefabricated, kit, or builder packages for garden studios. However, most would have poor thermal integrity or require a great deal of alteration work to get reasonable thermal performance and appropriately placed windows. The builder packages I looked at were expensive - around $100k.\nSo, with no prior experience, I set about learning how to do it myself.\nPhilosophy # My research and work led me to these guiding principles:\nHigh performance windows Windows are holes in the building fabric. They are hotspots of heat transfer. Investing in windows pays off disproportionately to their area. Continuous insulation Heat flows through the paths of least resistance. It is better to have complete coverage of thin insulation, than patchy coverage of thick insulation. So it makes sense to cover over the structural frame of the house, not just insulate in the gaps within the frame. Airtightness Uncontrolled air movement between inside and outside is a major cause of energy waste and discomfort, and reduces the effectiveness of insulation. Low thermal mass Despite conventional wisdom, high thermal mass (e.g. concrete) construction is often uncomfortable. This is obvious in mostly-cold climates like Canberra. Another reason to avoid high thermal mass construction is the carbon emissions associated with its production. Solar control Direct sunlight is I think essential for wellbeing in winter. But we need to control direct sunlight in summer. Roof eaves should be generous enough to provide good shade from above. East and west windows need seasonal external shading. Of course, I did not come up with any of this myself. All these principles (except for low thermal mass) are standard in good building systems such as PassivHaus, and increasingly mainstream in Europe and the US. Shockingly, they are still unusual in Australia.\nDesign # I spent about 8 weeks on research and design, going through several iterations.\nAn early concept sketch The combination of these design considerations was tricky:\nheight \u0026lt; 3m above ground level (see above) a gable roof (my daughter\u0026rsquo;s wish for a cottage vibe) sufficient slope on the roof for roof tiles (cottage vibe again) vapour control (see below) Having a gable roof with the required 18° slope brings one end of the roof down so far that only a low door can fit in there.\nAside: I could instead have had the door on a gable end wall. But I wanted the feeling of the ceiling raking up inside the entry. Like in Michael Pollan\u0026rsquo;s A Place of My Own.\nThis meant that\nthe door had to be manufactured as a window instead of a normal door; the floor could not be raised far off the ground; the roof had to be as thin as possible. Vapour control # If water vapour enters the ceiling or walls, it can condense and cause mould, which is a health hazard and can damage the structure. This problem is managed with some combination of\nreducing humidity inside the house (ventilation) allowing vapour to escape to outside (vapour-permeable materials and membranes; ventilated cavities) preventing humidity from getting into the structure (air barrier) keeping the interstitial surfaces warmer than the condensation temperature (generally using exterior air-impermeable rigid foam insulation) Fine. For my walls, I did the best-practice thing: vapour-permeable materials, covered with a vapour-permeable wrap, which was facing a ventilated cavity behind the weatherboard cladding. So any humid air that gets into the wall can permeate out through the wrap without causing a problem.\nWall design The roof is another story. Typically, roof tiles are laid on a framework of vertical battens then horizontal cross-battens, forming a cavity for ventilation and drainage. But in my case to reduce the height and also make tiling much easier, I chose a system with no cavity. ReadySlate tiles come with a waterproof backing and are nailed directly into plywood board. Alarm bells should be ringing at this point because this creates a vapour barrier. Condensation and mould are likely to form in the roof structure.\nMould damage from condensation in a roof structure. Source: https://www.greenbuildingadvisor.com/article/how-to-build-an-insulated-cathedral-ceiling The solution was to use an Intelligent Air Barrier on the inside of the structure, to stop humid air from entering in the first place. \u0026ldquo;Intelligent\u0026rdquo; in the sense that the material opens up to allow humid air through only under high vapour pressure: so in summer when the roof gets hot, any residual moisture in the roof can dry towards the interior where it can be safely ventilated. This system has been promoted by US company 475 High Performance Building Supply and backed up by hygrothermal modelling.\nThe system is however controversial\u0026hellip; several experts consider it risky. To mitigate the risk I designed in a Vapour Diffusion Port and also built in sensors for monitoring the moisture content of the roof structure over time.\n3D model # Computers were supposed to be bicycles for our minds. That is too often laughably untrue, but I think it is true of modelling buildings in 3D. I was able to flesh out my ideas and reveal issues I would never have thought of ahead of time. My tool of choice was SketchUp. I used tags and components to organise things.\nSketchUp tags following the construction sequence The 3D model was also incredibly useful in planning and costing the quantities of materials.

Solving indoor air quality and mould problems using mechanical ventilation with heat recovery. This is a sequel to my Home Journey of energy efficiency improvements.\nMould # I never paid much attention to indoor humidity. I did look at it now and then and it seemed high, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what to do about it.\nEventually I bought a dehumidifier. I used it next to our heat pump clothes dryer, which was otherwise getting noticably steamy. A nice benefit is that the dehumidifer generates heat. I also did some \u0026ldquo;deep drying\u0026rdquo; in specific rooms (run full blast for 24 hours with wardrobe doors open).\nWhat I failed to realise was that there was a dangerous buildup of humidity in one room: Bedroom 3. The exhaust fan from a bathroom shower is ducted through this room. And the cutout hole was not sealed 😱.\nShower exhaust fan ducted through Bedroom 3 The shower steam must have been leaking into this room every day of the 14 years of this house\u0026rsquo;s life. Luckily, for most of that time the room was very draughty. But I recently sealed up gaps in the ceiling and walls.\nHumidity levels in Bedroom 3\nOn 4 July 2024, I was up a ladder doing some more gap sealing in that room when I happened to notice condensation on a window. This window is hard to see: it is 2.5+ metres above ground, and covered with flyscreen and blinds. To get access to it I had to climb up the outside. What I found was shocking.\nCondensation and mould in the secondary glazing gap Condensation and mould (secondary glazing removed) Humid air had leaked behind the secondary glazing (acrylic sheet) and condensed there. I found the same kind of mould in the adjacent window, which had been blocked off with a rigid insulation panel.\nCondensation and mould on window that was blocked off with a rigid insulation panel It would be easy to blame this on the secondary glazing and the insulation panel. They certainly contributed to the problem. But I have dozens of other windows with secondary glazing, and 3 other windows blocked off with insulation panels; none have had condensation issues.\nFortunately, there was no apparent structural damage. Once the mould was cleaned away the timber looked and felt normal. I cleaned it with vinegar. Of course, I sealed the exhaust fan cutout. Then I ran the dehumidifier in the room.\nHumidity levels in Bedroom 3 after discovering mould What can be seen though, in the plot, is that humidity levels rose again afterwards (not quite to the same level). So humidity was still too high.\nIndoor Air Quality # You don\u0026rsquo;t want to be rebreathing a lot of air from your or other people\u0026rsquo;s lungs. I mean, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty obviously a bad idea. This kind of pollution is indicated by the level of CO2 in the air. Also, CO2 itself causes fatigue at high levels, and enables pathogens to survive longer in air.\nI switched on to indoor air quality when I built an airtight studio pod: CO2 levels rise rapidly in that small space depending on the number of people inside.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t think to check the CO2 levels in my house however, because it had always been so leaky. But I had done a lot of gap sealing work. When I did eventually start to monitor it I was in for a surprise. For reference:\nfresh outdoor air is around 400 ppm effects on sleep quality start above 1000 ppm my CO2 monitor sounds an alarm at 1400 ppm CO2 level of 1034 ppm in Living room It turned out that CO2 averaged around 1000 ppm in living areas with 2 or 3 people present. When we had a gathering of 8 people, the level reached 1400 ppm after 2 hours.\nWhat was more shocking was what happened in Bedroom 3 overnight (with 2 people).\nHigh CO2 levels in Bedroom 3 overnight\nThis is not healthy. Clearly something had to be done. As an immediate response, yes, windows were opened. But that is not pleasant in a Canberra winter.\nFor completeness, I should mention that indoor air quality can also be affected by outdoor sources such as traffic and bushfires. Here is an article about the effectiveness of air filters.\nVentilation system # The solution to mould and indoor air quality generally is continuous ventilation.\nPlanning # There are several strategies for continuous ventilation of homes. The most efficient is Heat Recovery Ventilation (HRV) also known as Mechanical Ventilation with Heat Recovery (MVHR). A heat exchanger transfers heat energy from exhaust air to intake air (in winter). And vice versa in summer. The downside is some cost and complexity, although a significant part of the cost and effort is installing ducting, which would be needed in any system, and the heat exchanger is a passive component (no moving parts).\nI had installed HRV in the airtight studio pod I built. But that was a \u0026ldquo;distributed\u0026rdquo; HRV: a pair of units fitted into the wall, each with its own fan and heat exchanger. A whole house is better suited to a \u0026ldquo;centralised\u0026rdquo; HRV: a ducted system. Why?\nthe cost of several distributed units could be higher than one centralised unit it would require an electrician to do the wiring (very expensive) most distributed units switch flow directions every 60 seconds or so, the sound of which is annoying there would have to be more external penetrations. A centralised HRV unit should be located where\nit can be ducted to outside lengths of duct runs to each room are minimised the fan noise will not be problematic drainage is available (for condensation). Here are some common HRV mistakes for anyone thinking of doing this.\nThe site I decided on was a dropped ceiling in the Family room, which is above the Kitchen cooktop and Laundry.\nSite for centralised HRV unit And here is my ducting plan. Blue lines are ducts to supply air vents; red lines are ducts to extract air vents. This is a \u0026ldquo;radial design\u0026rdquo;, which splits off all ducts immediately through distribution boxes.\nDucting plan\nBasically, air is extracted mostly from bathrooms and kitchen; and fresh air is supplied to bedrooms and living areas. Specifically:\nSupply Extract Study Living/Dining (NW corner) Bedroom 2 Bedroom 3 Family Ensuite Kitchen (Living) Pantry Family (above HRV unit) Bathroom I excluded Bedroom 1 because it is relatively leaky, is always cold, and can be zoned off from the rest of the house.\nHere are two different ways to decide on the required airflow rate:\nMy conditioned floor area is about 140m2 with 3.4m ceilings, which equals a volume of 476 m3. For a nominal airflow rate of 0.4 exchanges per hour, that is 190 m3/hr. My desired air extraction rates at each point: Bathroom, Ensuite, Kitchen each 15 L/s; Family, Pantry each 6 L/s. This adds up to 57 L/s, which is 205 m3/hr. A similar result. In either case, this nominal airflow rate should only be about 60% of the maximum/boost rate (used for occasional purging), which means the maximum rate should be around 320 m3/hr.\nSystem # The HRV unit I decided on was Dantherm RCV 320 P1 for $4900. It has a maximum airflow rate of 320 m3/hr. As far as I can tell there is not much to choose between this and similar products from Stiebel Eltron and Fantech, apart from being about 15% cheaper (based on some prices I saw at the time of writing). A cheaper option that could work well is Mitsubishi Lossnay ~$2000. I decided against it because it does not have automatic adjustment of fan speed based on humidity.\nThe ducts, vents, distribution boxes, and plenum boxes were Alnor (systemy wentylacji) products. I bought everything from Dehum and they went above and beyond to help me plan the system. Total cost $8000.\nDucting # I ran semi-rigid 75mm ducting inside the thermal envelope. This is preferable to running ducting in an unconditioned roofspace or under the floor, because of thermal losses. In any case, I do not have either a roofspace or an underfloor space. It came grey; I gave it a rough spray of white paint.\n100 metres of semi-rigid 75mm HDPE ducting Then I made a lot of holes in the walls. Remembering that there are electrical cables in there. Don\u0026rsquo;t try this at home kids.\nQuite a lot of holes as it turned out. I used a hole-saw drill bit. It was worth buying a proper Cobalt one.\n76mm, 127mm, and 152mm diameter cutouts A few challenges:\nThe 76mm holes I drilled were too tight. I could get the duct through, but not without scraping off the paint. I had to expand the holes a bit by sanding them. Flecks of paint still went everywhere. A couple of times I drilled holes in the wrong spot. Usually because I had not expected a stud to be in the way. The duct is really inflexible over the short distance from one side of the wall to the other, so the holes had to be well lined up. One time I cut the duct a bit too short for comfort, and it was a struggle to get it connected at both ends. In two places (Living room and WC) I did not want the plenum box to be visible, so I took off a wall panel to install the plenum box inside the wall. Duct from Living to Study Ducts in Living room and into WC. A plenum box is hidden inside the bulkhead. Duct from Living through WC to Ensuite. Plenum box hidden inside the wall. Ducts in Pantry/Coats and into Bedroom 2. Plenum box visible. Supply and extract vents # The 75mm vent plugs into a plenum box which has a 100mm outlet for a vent. The vents for supply and extract are slightly different as they are optimised for diffusing vs sucking. The airflow through each can be adjusted by twisting the head.\nSupply air vent and plenum box in Bedroom 3 Supply air vent in Bedroom 2 I ran into a problem with this vent in Bedroom 2: the wall was unexpectedly thick, 180mm. That was too thick for the neck of the plenum box to reach the other side. I ended up taking off a wall panel and spanning the gap with larger diameter pipe; I could then plug the plenum box into one side, and plug the cut-off neck of another one into the other side to take the vent.\nMaking a pipe across the 180mm-thick wall into Bedroom 2 I had the same problem, an extra-thick wall, with this extract vent in the Kitchen.\nExtract air vent in Kitchen/Living But this time I did not want to take off a wall panel. So I extended the neck of the plenum box with a duct joiner from Bunnings.\nPlenum box extended with a duct joiner from Bunnings For this extract vent in the Bathroom, I was able to come in through the dropped ceiling.\nExtract air vent in Bathroom Intake and exhaust # The ducts to and from outside need to be insulated, as they carry cold air through a warm space. These ones are rigid, made from expanded polypropylene.\nExpanded polypropylene 125mm duct These are 125mm diameter ducts. That\u0026rsquo;s the inner diameter. The outer diameter is 156mm. So I had to use this monster to make the holes in the external wall:\n152mm hole drill bit Holes for intake and exhaust The intake should not be too close to the exhuast vent, for obvious reasons. So I used a bend piece to send the exhaust away some distance. I covered the end of it with flywire. For the supply vent I just plugged in a $15 grille cover from eBay.\nIntake and exhaust vents outside Integration # Here is the HRV unit completely installed. It is mounted on the wall. I plugged the distribution boxes (splitting off into 5 ducts each) directly into the unit, which is unusual. (If the distribution boxes were any bigger they would not have fitted there). The condensation drain, power cord, and control panel drop down into the laundry.\nHRV installed What about aesthetics?\nMeh. Function takes precedence over form. Anyway I quite like industrial style.\nCalibration # Once the unit is switched on it must be calibrated, which means adjusting the fan speeds to match the desired flow rate for the home; and also balancing intake with exhaust rates so that air doesn\u0026rsquo;t leak through elsewhere.\nIt is possible to do this using the control panel on the unit, but it is easier and more precise to use the Dantherm software on a connected laptop (Windows only unfortunately).\nDantherm PC tool\nHere is my calibration setup:\nCalibrating the HRV You need a differential pressure gauge (manometer) to measure the pressure drop from one side of a fan to the other. I bought a used analog one $48.50 from eBay. Then you look up a chart (or use the software) to see what pressure drop corresponds to your desired airflow rate.\nDifferential pressure gauge: Dwyer Magnehelic 0-60 Pa In my case for an airflow of 191 m3/hr I needed a pressure drop of 58 Pascals (in the exhaust fan). To reach that I had to increase the exhaust fan speed to 3096 rpm. For some reason the target pressure drop for the intake fan is always lower (about 10% lower); this may be because incoming cold air expands as it is heated, or because of extra pressure inside due to warmer air? In my case the target pressure drop for the intake fan was 50 Pascals, which I reached with a fan speed of 2004 rpm.\nUPDATE 2024-08-03: It turned out that my initial calibration was wrong because the ball pump needles I used to plug the gauge into the unit were too short. They weren\u0026rsquo;t getting all the way through the insulation layer so weren\u0026rsquo;t getting a good reading. When I redid it, the situation was reversed: extract fan speed was lower at 3050 rpm, and supply fan speed was higher at 3860 rpm. This makes more sense to me because my supply lines are longer and more circuitous than my extract lines.\nUPDATE 2024-08-08: I was a bit unhappy with the high supply fan speed, because of the sound it makes (although the system usually runs at a low level anyway). Why was the supply fan speed calibrated to be so high? Well, to overcome the resistance in the airflow path (static pressure). I had thought it was just the length of the ducting that was to blame, but then I remembered the external vent cover. When I looked closely, the insect mesh built in to it was rigid plastic that blocked more than 50% of the area! So, I replaced this with fine flywire mesh and recalibrated. The nominal supply fan speed came down significantly from 3860 to 3390 rpm.\nThis calibration process sets the nominal airflow rate which is called \u0026ldquo;step 3\u0026rdquo;. Step 2 is defined as 70% of that, and step 1 I set to 35%. Step 4 is always max rpm, used for purging if needed.\nHere is an article describing another way to balance an HRV.\nOperation # The unit can be operated by a simple wired control panel, or by an app. All I had to do was plug in an ethernet cable and open the app while connected to the same wifi network. The app is fun because you can see the heat exchanger in action. It\u0026rsquo;s like magic.\nDantherm Residential app\nThere are three main operating modes: manual, automatic, and scheduled. Automatic adjusts the airflow rate based on humidity detected in the extract air; this is useful when showering or cooking. It is possible to fit a CO2 sensor or VOC sensor too, apparently. But for now I find that I have to use either manual mode or a schedule when there are more than a few people in the house, to keep the CO2 levels in check.\nResults # It\u0026rsquo;s been running for a few days now. CO2 levels have been averaging around 700 ppm where they were 1000 ppm previously, indicating improved air quality. I could probably run it harder but I\u0026rsquo;m happy with this level for now.\nUPDATE 2024-08-03: Bedroom 3 overnight test. Running at \u0026ldquo;step 2\u0026rdquo; (supplying about 35 L/s), the CO2 level in occupied Bedroom 3 averaged 1200 ppm. That is a lot better than it was before (up to 2800 ppm). And despite supplying 35 L/s of fresh air, the house stayed 18°C above outdoor temperature (15° vs -3°) with no heating overnight.\nUPDATE 2024-08-04: Bedroom 3 overnight, same conditions but with door open: CO2 averaged 900 ppm. That is significantly better than with the door closed. Therefore, the airflow path through the 10mm door undercut is not enough. I have ordered these sound-dampening door vents from Tight House.\nThere has been a noticable change to humidity levels throughout the house:\nStudy: temperature and humidity before and after turning on HRV\nBedroom 3: temperature and humidity before and after turning on HRV (dehumidifier run at end)\nFamily room: temperature and humidity before and after turning on HRV\nMore subtly, I think temperatures have been evened out a little bit between rooms: colder rooms receive airflow with heat harvested from Living (which has solar gain, hydronic manifold, and cooking).\nI expect that we will see benefits in summer too. The HRV has a function to bypass the heat exchanger for use on summer nights: it is then simply circulating cool outdoor air throughout the house.\nConclusions # It is bizarre that we build houses in cold climates without considering the need for fresh air in winter. We rely on leaks — the mistakes of builders and electricians, and the vagaries of the wind — for our fresh air.\nIt is commonly believed that homes don\u0026rsquo;t need continuous ventilation unless they are super airtight. When I or others talk about HRV on MEEH, a popular Facebook group, the frequent response is that it makes no sense unless you know that you have a tight house.\nBut how many people monitor their CO2 levels? How many people do not know they have a problem?\nJohn Konstantakoloulos of Efficiency Matrix has said\n\u0026ldquo;Having a known good course of air is good for any home no matter how leaky it is. Air tightness just improves the effectiveness and efficiency of HRV\u0026rdquo;.\nI agree.\n","date":"1 August 2024","permalink":"/posts/home-ventilation/","section":"Articles","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  How to breathe well (without freezing).

UPDATES\nTom Hughes reposted with comments / threads Alex Zeller reposted with comments / threads Anthony Wright (CSIRO) published a response David Perry gave his perspective When I say NatHERS here, I really mean the simulation engine used in all accredited NatHERS software, known as Chenath.\nThe NatHERS simulation engine has been developed by CSIRO since the scheme started in the 1990s. I am proposing that the source code be publicly released.\nWhy? # NatHERS software implements a complex model of heat transfer in buildings. Some of the underlying sub-models have been described in broad terms in published papers. But many of the hundreds of assumptions and details inherent in such a model are not visible.\nAs the Australian building code targets higher performance building standards, it is exposing some limitations of our models. If left unchecked these can cause perverse outcomes. It is essential that we can have an open conversation about appropriate assumptions. And that starts with a full knowledge of the current system.\nThe NatHERS software has a special status in that:\nit is specified in the building code, which directly affects millions of people; it was developed with public funding. A cornerstone of science is openness. There would be greater trust in a model that can be scrutinised and analysed.\nWouldn\u0026rsquo;t this create chaos? # No.\nThe governance of NatHERS software would not be affected by releasing the source code. The current custodians (CSIRO and the NatHERS Administrator) would retain full control of their codebase, and that is the only one that can be used for certification to the National Construction Code. License fees would be unaffected.\nOne of the most successful building energy models internationally is Energy Plus, developed by the US Department of Energy. It is open source software. In fact, this is sometimes used in Australia to prove compliance of commercial buildings.\nDoes the Australian Government do open source? # Yes.\nCSIRO has already released software under an open licence, such as for example an energy system model.\nAn online repository of open source software, Github, lists 43 Australian Government agencies having code on its platform.\nOne element of the Digital Transformation Agency\u0026rsquo;s Digital Service Standard v1 is: Make source code open.

This house is designed on a triangular geometry theme.

Light globes get hot so can not be in contact with insulation.\nDownlight with cover off, showing lack of insulation. In this case the gap in insulation is about 600mm x 550mm (a full rafter bay across). And there are 12 of these lights in the living/dining/kitchen room.

How does the current system deliver on those goals? The concept of energy efficiency is pretty vague. It probably took shape after the 1973 oil crisis: we need to reduce our total energy usage, so as to be less dependent on oil imports. Then it morphed into something much broader\u0026hellip;\nDefinitely something to do with trees and lightbulbs\nToday, the following are commonly cited as goals of housing energy efficiency regulation:\nreduce carbon emissions; reduce peak load on the electricity grid, avoiding costly upgrades; reduce running costs; improve comfort and health. Other benefits flow from these, such as mental health and productivity; the ability to cope with extreme weather events; and improved durability of a structure that remains free of mould.\nHousing energy efficiency regulation in Australia targets average annual energy use per square metre. Unlike the goals listed above, average annual energy use in itself is not a meaningful goal. Of course, if we reduced energy use down to zero, we would meet all of the goals (ignoring embodied carbon for now). In fact, near-zero energy use can be achieved, for example with Passivhaus construction. But Australian housing is very far from that.\nHow does the building code deliver on specific, meaningful goals?\nReduce carbon emissions? # If the goal was to reduce carbon emissions, the building code would regulate embodied carbon. Embodied carbon refers to emissions from constructing a building, including from materials like concrete and steel. According to the head of UNSW\u0026rsquo;s School of Built Environment, \u0026ldquo;for any new building constructed in Australia today, we expect at least half of its total carbon footprint over its life will be embodied carbon, possibly even more.\u0026quot;\nAnd NatHERS, I argue, is biased towards concrete. Others agree: architect Matt Delroy-Carr says \u0026ldquo;The rating system heavily favours masonry construction … The more concrete and bricks you put into the project, the higher the star rating, but inevitably, the higher the carbon footprint.\u0026quot;\nIf the goal was to reduce carbon emissions, electricity use in sunny daytime hours would count far less than on winter nights. One third of all households and businesses in Australia have solar panels and this continues to grow. Even for households without solar panels, the emissions intensity of the electricity grid is less in daylight hours.\nGeneration in the National Electricity Market in the 24 hours from 16:00 22 May 2024 (source)\nSpecifically, this means that energy used for cooling is much less important than energy used for heating. Because the times when cooling is most needed are the times of peak solar generation. But currently, we simply add together total heating and cooling loads.\nFurthermore, it makes no sense to use summer-generated solar excess (the easy problem) to offset heating demand on cloudy winter days or nights (the hard problem). Can we please stop talking about this as a \u0026ldquo;net zero house\u0026rdquo;?\nReduce peak load? # Load at peak demand times is difficult to model in practice as it depends on occupant behaviour and specific thermostat settings and timing.\nReduce running costs? # There is some precedent here: for existing houses the voluntary Residential Efficiency Scorecard gives a running cost star rating. Partly this is based on the efficiency of specific heating and cooling appliances. But also critical are air leaks and poorly installed insulation — major causes of energy waste in practice.\nArguably, the relevant measure for all the above goals is energy use per dwelling or per occupant, not energy use per square metre as is currently the case.\nImprove comfort and health? # If the goal was to improve thermal comfort, again we would recognise crucial factors like uncontrolled air leakage; completeness of insulation install; internal window coverings. This is from a cool climate perspective.\nPerhaps a quantified measure of comfort like PMV could be used, as it often is for commercial buildings in Australia. This incorporates the Mean Radiant Temperature effects of any cold surfaces. Certainly the effect of cold concrete slab floors should be better accounted for.\nOn the health side, mechanical ventilation is important for air quality. And mould risk should be checked; crucially this requires that a realistic model of thermal bridging be used. Which is not currently the case.\nWhat about Whole-of-Home? # The new 2022 building code includes a Whole-of-Home (WoH) component, which estimates and regulates the energy required to run specific heating, cooling, hot water, and some other appliances. This seems to address some of the issues above:\nEnergy use is measured in terms of the societal cost of energy. This includes the following: energy costs to the building user costs to the environment in terms of greenhouse gas emissions time-of-use impact on energy networks. Sounds great! But: this does not apply in any way to the main NatHERS star rating (\u0026ldquo;NatHERS thermal\u0026rdquo;). The WoH component is an additional step. From what I have seen so far, the WoH component is relatively easy to comply with by specifying solar panels or efficient heating, cooling, and hot water systems. It may stop people from installing wasteful appliances. But in general I don\u0026rsquo;t think that it changes the way that houses are designed or built. I would be happy to be proven wrong.\nConclusion # Housing energy efficiency regulation in Australia targets average annual energy use, per square metre. But that does not align well with meaningful goals like reducing carbon emissions or improving thermal comfort. We need more effective policies.\nOne way forward might be Anthony Wratten\u0026rsquo;s proposal to combine a Whole-of-Home rating with a measure of comfort/health, removing the star rating based on annual energy use. This would also need to be combined with a limit on embodied carbon.\nIn the absence of specific regulation, building designers can and should work towards meaningful goals anyway. For example, Powerhaus Engineering\u0026rsquo;s app can show modelled energy demand matched against solar generation.\nFinally, the building code probably won\u0026rsquo;t achieve its goals without as-built verification.\n","date":"30 May 2024","permalink":"/posts/the-confusion-at-the-heart-of-the-building-code/","section":"Articles","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  What are the goals of housing energy efficiency regulation?

But this depends on at least two questionable assumptions. that soils conduct heat away from concrete slabs only slowly. that insulation of concrete floors has complete coverage. Are we pushing people into bad choices?\nThermal mass # Thermal mass is not always a good thing. Its benefit, if used correctly, is to slow down temperature changes and smooth out the day/night cycle. But this can also be achieved in lightweight construction with good insulation and airtightness. With the added flexibility for rapid heating or cooling if needed.\nThe New Zealand government\u0026rsquo;s Building Performance website says:\nThermal mass can be a liability if used incorrectly, so it should be kept away from: cold, draughty areas such as entryways or unheated hallways rooms that face south or don't get much winter sun areas with poor insulation. Concrete slab on ground # Ground coupling is sometimes recommended to access the deep store of thermal mass in the ground. This may make sense in warm climates. But in a cold climate such as Canberra or Melbourne ground coupling is a liability for most of the year. A concrete slab on ground is therefore a problem unless it has excellent insulation.\nThe question is, how much of a problem is it?\nHeat loss to ground # NatHERS uses a simple equation for the heat transfer between slab and ground, described in Alterman, Luo, Moghtaderi \u0026amp; Chen (2012). The two key parameters for the rate of heat loss to the ground are thermal conductivity and diffusivity (which is conductivity divided by volumetric heat capacity).\nThe most important thing to know about soil conductivity and diffusivity is that they vary strongly with soil type and saturation. One study by Xie, Lu, Ren \u0026amp; Horton (2018) showed that diffusivity increases rapidly as dry soils are wetted.\nThe NatHERS values are:\nconductivity 1.5 W/mK diffusivity 4.6 × 10-7m2/s I do not know the source or basis of these values.\nThe tool used for Passivhaus construction, PHPP, has different default values:\nconductivity 2.0 W/mK diffusivity 10.0 × 10-7m2/s An experiment # Here is a small 3-bedroom house in Canberra. It is the same model I used in this article on house size.\nI made one version with a concrete slab on ground (exposed throughout), and another with a suspended timber floor. Here are the results:\nTimber Concrete slab on ground Underfloor insulation R4.0 none NatHERS star rating 6.8★ 7.1★ Heating (MJ / m2 . year) 104 108 Cooling (MJ / m2 . year) 27 9 This is with an enclosed (disconnected) subfloor, the best case.\nSo, according to NatHERS, the concrete slab on ground is clearly preferred.\nbut wait # We know that ground thermal diffusivity varies over a wide range. What happens if we adopt the default values from the Passivhaus PHPP tool instead, for example?\nTimber Concrete slab on ground, different parameters Underfloor insulation R4.0 none NatHERS star rating 6.8★ 6.7★ Heating (MJ / m2 . year) 104 126 Cooling (MJ / m2 . year) 27 9 Now the situation is reversed, and we should prefer the suspended timber floor.\nSlab insulation # The results for the concrete slab house can easily be improved by adding under-slab or slab-edge insulation. But is this realistic?\nMy understanding of NatHERS is that under-slab insulation is assumed to be complete over the whole area of the slab. It does not account for missing insulation under footings (which is near-universal).\nAnd, I think, slab-edge insulation is assumed to cover the whole of the slab edge; whereas the NCC specifies it only up to ground level.\nThis is what happens when your slab edge insulation only comes up to ground level (as per NCC) I can not be sure about this because the precise implementation of NatHERS is kept hidden. Which is another story.\nConclusion # The preference that NatHERS gives to concrete floors in cool climates has, I believe, led to peverse outcomes in terms of comfort, energy use, and embodied carbon. I have shown that by changing soil parameters within their typical range, the supposed advantage of concrete over timber floors can be reversed.\nThere is more to say about how NatHERS treats concrete floors and thermal mass. For instance, in the model above its benefit is mostly for cooling; but is it really meaningful to lump heating and cooling together? I explore this in The confusion at the heart of the building code.\nNotes # Here are the model files for these houses. Normal people can not change the ground model parameters, but I used my geek superpowers to do it.\n","date":"27 May 2024","permalink":"/posts/nathers-is-biased-towards-concrete/","section":"Articles","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  NatHERS \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e likes concrete floors.

In two ways. Because small houses naturally have more surface area; and energy use limits are per square metre, not per house. Why do we limit energy use per square metre? # NatHERS star ratings are used to define the minimum \u0026ldquo;energy efficiency\u0026rdquo; of houses in Australia. This is a limit on heating and cooling energy per square metre. It is not a limit on the energy required by the house as a whole. A study recently found that Australian homes are getting bigger and bigger, and it’s wiping out gains in energy efficiency. That is, while predicted heating and cooling energy per square metre has been going down with updates to the building code, the amount per house has been going up. Um, good work everyone?\nPresumably, the reasoning for a per-square-metre limit is that bigger houses can accommodate more people. I imagine the designers of the scheme saying \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not fair to put the same energy budget on a 4-bedroom house as a 2-bedroom house.\u0026rdquo; However, back in reality, household sizes have gone down while house sizes have gone up.\nNew homes in Australia are some of the biggest in the world, averaging over 230m2. Housing in Australia is also notoriously expensive. But most people don\u0026rsquo;t know that construction in Australia is not expensive on a per square metre basis:\nAverage build cost (per m2) of eleven building types in USD. Source: Turner \u0026amp; Townsend International construction market survey 2023\nCompared to similar countries, we are building huge houses at low quality, and paying the price.\nHouse size in NatHERS # Here is a small house, made up of 3m x 3m rooms:\nAnd a bigger house, the same but with larger 4.5m x 4.5m rooms:\nAnd a tiny house, with roughly the same zone locations:\nThey share the same specifications:\nCanberra climate zone with suburban exposure; north is up the page Brick veneer walls, 2400mm high, with R2.5 insulation Aluminium thermally-broken double glazed windows (ATB-004-01) Windows are 30% of wall area All fully openable Two external doors Pitched / Attic metal (hip) roof with R5.0 ceiling and R1.3 foil-faced roof blanket Suspended timber floors with R2.5, 300mm enclosed subfloor Eaves all around at wall height, projecting 600mm They also have (almost) the same percentages and location of zone types:\nDaytime 47% (including kitchen/living), north Bedroom 32%, one third north, two thirds south Unconditioned 21%, south Here are the results:\nTiny Small Bigger Floor area (m2) 42.8 85.8 181.6 NatHERS star rating 6.3★ 6.7★ 7.3★ Heating (MJ / m2 . year) 153 145 103 Cooling (MJ / m2 . year) 56 35 21 Total energy use (MJ / year) 7083 12196 17483 Area Correction Factor 0.706 0.745 0.899 By increasing the floor area, the rating has gone up from 6.3 stars (fail) to 7.3 stars (pass). At the same time, the heating and cooling energy required by the house as a whole has increased dramatically. And of course, the amount of embodied carbon in the building has increased too.\nHere are the model files for these houses.\nAdjusting for house size # Why are the per-square-metre heating and cooling loads higher in the smaller houses? Mostly because they have more external wall area compared to floor area. This is just basic geometry. I should note though that the issue is more complicated than just geometry: bigger buildings are not just expanded versions of smaller buildings.\nThose involved in NatHERS and the building code are aware of this surface area issue. To compensate for it, the modelled heating and cooling loads are multiplied by an area correction factor. In a paper Area Correction Factors in AccuRate v1.1.4.1, Chen (2012) explains:\nThe area correction factors were obtained by simulating the energy use of an idealised house using NatHERS and changing the floor plan size from 49 m2 to 625 m2 in six steps. Assuming that this house plan should receive the same rating regardless of floor size ... The idealized house design used in developing the area correction factors (from Isaacs (2004))\nThe details are glossed over, other than \u0026ldquo;After feedback from industry was considered, the area correction factors evolved into dimensionless factors in 2005\u0026rdquo;. The actual area correction factor is defined by a mathematical function of the Net Conditioned Floor Area and is different in each climate zone. In Canberra (climate zone 24) it looks like this:\nArea Correction Factor as defined in NatHERS climate zone 24 (a 5th-order polynomial!)\nIn all cases, if the conditioned area is less than 50m2, it is set to 50m2. That is, no further adjustment is made for houses with less than 50m2 of conditioned floor area.\nBut as can be seen in the results above, the area correction as currently implemented does not seem to adjust well for the effects of house size. In effect, we are incentivising larger houses.\nAnd in any case, as long as the building code limits are per-square-metre, there is little prospect of overall energy use (or embodied carbon) in the sector coming down.\n","date":"23 May 2024","permalink":"/posts/nathers-makes-it-hard-to-build-small-houses/","section":"Articles","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Or to put it another way, NatHERS lets big houses off the hook.
